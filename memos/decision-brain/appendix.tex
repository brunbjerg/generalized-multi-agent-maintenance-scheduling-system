\section*{Appendix}
This appendix contains the pseudo-code and mathematical models associated with each metaheuristic implementation. 

The mathematical models here are only guiding, as everything is implemented as metaheuristics a one-to-one mapping
between the mathematical models and the actual implementation can lose some nuances.

\subsection*{Pseudo Code}

All implemented algorithms are based on a variant of the Large Neighborhood Search metaheuristic with some modification to enable both message
passing and solution state shared through atomic pointer swapping.

I have decided to include the mathematical models of the four different models. It is not meant to provide a through understanding
but show how the larger process can be modelled through a series of smaller models. \textbf{Notice:} the "meta variables" sections are
the decision variables (and time $\tau$) from other models that are being used in the respective model as a parameters (meaning they are 
not variables in that specific model and that model cannot then change the value of the variable).
