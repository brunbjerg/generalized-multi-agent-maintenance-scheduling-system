\section{Project Introduction}

The project aims to make a real-time scheduling system that is able to \textbf{optimize} and \textbf{coordinate} state across
different decision making actors. This is done by modelling stakeholders decisions individually and then implementing novel coordination
mechanisms between the models. To solve this problem I have developed an API that runs on Total
Energies production servers so that each relevant stakeholder is able to interact with the part 
of the schedule that he is responsible for through dedicated API endpoints. Each of these API 
endpoints (not fully implemented) have a corresponding simple frontend which includes upload functions for data not available 
in the Total Energies IT systems, simple live statistics of the current state 
of the scheduling application such as resource consumption, and .xlsx export functions.).

The main rationale for this approach is that you can only optimize schedules to a certain extend before you need to coordinate between 
stakeholders. This is usually due to practical things such as, safety, regulation, human factors, handling errors due to low quality data. 
Solving this requires a diverse range of skills of which I only posses a few. It is my hope that Decision Brain
would be interested in a collaboration that would prove mutually beneficial for both parties.
