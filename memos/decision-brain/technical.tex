I will provide a high-level overview of what it is that the current application is doing. I believe that 
this will make it clear how Decision Brain can help to make the project succeed.


\subsection*{Architecture of the Scheduling System}
I have spend a significant part of my Ph.D. program refining and testing different architectures to enable
meta-heuristics to coordinator state in real-time. The latest version is shown below.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{../../figures/ordinator-architecture.tex}
	\drawOrdinatorArchitecture{basisinput=1cm}

	\caption{
		High level overview of the architecture of the scheduling system. Persistance holds
		all data whether from SAP, user-input, or other systems; the Orchestrator is the part of the 
		system that manages the lifetimes of the metaheuristics that does the actual optimization;
		the decision variable are all store together are are shared among all optimization meta-heuristics, 
		each algorithm can write to its own state but only read the state of its neighbors; the UI components
		each communicate with the algorithms that correspond to the individual stakeholder
	}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Key Lessons:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Message passing between metaheuristics are unworkable, e.g. a microservice architecture is bad approach
	\item Optimization problems are difficult due to large and complex solution spaces. Allowing models/meta-heuristics
		  to use each others solutions as parameters allows you to keep solution spaces small while preserving the 
		  ability to model the system. 
	\item The operational setting is much more complex than you think and changes faster than think. Developing large integrated models 
		  is a nightmare as changes become more and more difficult the larger a model gets.
\end{itemize}

The key feature that this architecture enables it that we can move away from hierarchical approachs and 
instead model each stakeholder individually with the responsibilities that exactly that person is responsible 
for. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\input{../../figures/model-setup-hexagon.tex}
	\centering
	\drawModelSetupHexagon
	\caption{
		Each meta-heuristic (Actor-based Large Neighborhood Search, see algorithm~\ref{alg:actor-based-large-neighborhood-search} on page \pageref{alg:actor-based-large-neighborhood-search}) is here shown as a hexagon.
		Each meta-heuristic is based on a mathematical model each of which are found in the appendix. \textbf{Notice}: this system is not 
		hierarchical each metaheuristics reads the solutions of the other metaheuristic but they are not dependent on them for their 
		function.
