\section*{Goals of the External Stay}
For me the three most significant goals of the external stay would be something like:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Gauge whether my Ph.D. project can be implemented in practice. 
	\item Integrate my application into a test environment at Decision Brain.
	\item Get competent feedback on my scheduling approach. 
\end{itemize}

I have a somewhat naive belief that I have found a solid scalable approach to modelling a generic 
maintenance scheduling system (see \ref{sec:technical} section below). 

My code work on backend SAP tables so I believe that there may be a possibility of integrating my 
code into a system at Decision Brain. Finding a way to integrate my system into a Decision Brain
where the relevant team at Decision Brain would then be able to judge the potential financial value 
of a full implementation of my project would be the ultimate goal of the external stay.

Something similar to what is elaborated on in \cite{palmerMaintenancePlanningScheduling2019} which has a 
more practical orientation. 

\section*{Setup of the External Stay}
My initial idea of a setup with Decision Brain, would be that I stable contact for the duration of the external stay with which
I can discuss my ideas and that I can rely on for help.

\begin{itemize}
	\item First month: Determine if I could integration my application in a relevant project at Decision Brain. (Maybe a git branch)
	\item Second month:  
	\item Third month:
\end{itemize}
