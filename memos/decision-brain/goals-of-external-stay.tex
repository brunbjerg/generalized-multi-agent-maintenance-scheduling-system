\section*{Goals of the External Stay}
For me the three most significant goals of the external stay would be:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Gauge whether my Ph.D. project can be implemented in practice. 
	\item Integrate my application into a test environment at Decision Brain.
	\item Get competent feedback on my scheduling approach. 
\end{itemize}

I have a somewhat naive belief that I have found a solid scalable approach to modelling a generic 
maintenance scheduling system (see \ref{sec:technical} section below). I am 
modelling something that is similar to what is described on \cite{palmerMaintenancePlanningScheduling2019} 
which is a source that has a more practical orientation than most academic works. 

My code work on backend SAP tables and user-inputs so I believe that there may be a possibility of integrating my 
code into a system at Decision Brain if this is deemed of value. Integrating the system at Decision 
Brain would be ideal as I think that it would enable us judge the potential financial value 
of a full implementation of my project. It would also make it clear if it is a project that is worth chasing further
by Decision Brain. 

\section*{Setup of the External Stay}
My initial idea of a setup with Decision Brain, would be that I get a stable contact for the duration of the external stay with which
I can discuss my ideas and that I can rely on for help.

\begin{itemize}
	% TODO: This is not that great should be changed
	\item First month: Determine if I can integrate my application in a relevant project at Decision Brain.
	\item Second month: Work on implementing the scheduling system in Decision Brain's IT infrastructure.
	\item Third month: Assess the feasibility of the project and possible course corrections.
\end{itemize}
