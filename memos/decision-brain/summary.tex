\section*{Summary}
I am doing a research project in collaboration with Total Energies. I am in the process of modelling 
their scheduling process in a way that will allow us to optimize their operations. My main concerns
in this process is how to make the project succeed with the numerous decision that I have to make but 
which I feel poorly equiped to make. It is my hope that an external stay at Decision Brain will help
me understand what the best appraoch are to making my project succeed, both on the Ph.D. but also 
after my graduation. Below is a list of my main issues so far that I have failed to solve by myself. 

\textbf{Main Issues:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Developing the API without a frontend to get feedback 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I is hard to get the Stakeholders that are actually doing the work to understand the idea without developing a frontend.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Many topics are outside the scope of my research project due to a lack of the essential skills. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Stakeholder management, and UX development.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Gauging the financial vaule of the project; whether I should continue implementing or keep it academic. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I think that the team at Decision Brain will be able to gauge this in less than a month.	
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
