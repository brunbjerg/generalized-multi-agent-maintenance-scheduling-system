\section{Summary}
I am doing a research project in collaboration with Total Energies. I am currently modelling 
their scheduling process in a way that will allow us to optimize their maintenance operations. My main concern
in this process is making the project succeed with the numerous decisions that I have to make but 
which I feel unequipped for. I believe that an external stay at Decision Brain will provide the 
expertise and guidance needed to making the project succeed or informing the future direction of my career path. 
Below is a list of my main issues so far that I have struggled to solve by myself. 

\textbf{My Main Issues:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Developing a correct API without a frontend to get user feedback, especially one the dynamic components of the API.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Stakeholders struggle to grasp the concept without a visual representation, making it challenging to communicate the API's functionality.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Many topics are outside the scope of my research project due to a lack of the essential skills. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Primarily stakeholder management and UX development.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Uncertainty about the project's financial viability and whether to continue its development within an academic setting.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I think that the team at Decision Brain will be able to provide guidance here.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Incentives for Decision Brain:} 
\begin{itemize} 
	\item Gain a fresh perspective on developing scheduling solutions. 
	\item Opportunity to evaluate and potentially recruit a skilled researcher. 
	\item Access to a partial implementation of innovative scheduling code.
\end{itemize}
