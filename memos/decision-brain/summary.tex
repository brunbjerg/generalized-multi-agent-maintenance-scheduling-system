\section*{Summary}
I am doing a research project in collaboration with Total Energies. I am in the process of modelling 
their scheduling process in a way that will allow us to optimize their maintenance operations. My main concern
in this process is how to make the project succeed with the numerous decisions that I have to make but 
which I feel poorly equipped to make. I believe that an external stay at Decision Brain will provide the 
expertise and guidance needed to making the project succeed or informing the future direction of my career path. 
This includes both on the Ph.D. project and potentially after my graduation. Below is a list of my main issues so far 
that I have failed to solve by myself. 

\textbf{Main Issues:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Developing a correct API without a frontend to get user feedback, especially one the dynamic components of the API.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Stakeholders struggle to grasp the concept without a visual representation, making it challenging to communicate the API's functionality.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Many topics are outside the scope of my research project due to a lack of the essential skills. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Primarily stakeholder management and UX development.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Uncertainty about the project's financial viability and whether to continue its development within an academic setting.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I think that the team at Decision Brain will be able to gauge this in less than a month.	
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
