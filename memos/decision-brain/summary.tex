\section{Summary}
I am a third year PhD fellow at DTU Construct and DTU Management and I am currently involved in a research project in collaboration with Total Energies. The focus of my thesis is modelling 
their scheduling process in a way that will allow for optimizing their maintenance operations by informing key decision makers in real time. While I feel
the product could be of great utility, I face a number difficult problems which I have outlined below. I believe that an external stay at Decision Brain will provide the 
expertise and guidance needed to making the project succeed or informing the future direction of my career path. 
Below is a list of my main issues so far that I have struggled to solve by myself. 

\textbf{My Main Issues:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Developing an API without a frontend to get user feedback, especially one the dynamic components of the API.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Stakeholders struggle to grasp the concept without a visual representation, making it challenging to communicate the API's functionality. Developing both is time consuming.
	\end{itemize}
	\item I am lacking essential skills such as effecitive stakeholder management and UX development. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Working with Decision Brain I hope to learn how to be effective at what I do best and understand what it takes to 
			  rely on people that have the essential skills do not.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Uncertainty about the project's financial viability, step towards practical application, and how to manange a software project such as this one.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I think that the team at Decision Brain will be able to provide guidance here.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Incentives for Decision Brain:} 
\begin{itemize} 
	\item Gain a fresh perspective on developing scheduling solutions. 
	\item Opportunity to evaluate and potentially recruit a skilled researcher. 
	\item Access to a partial implementation of innovative scheduling code.
	\item Aquire personal contacts within Total Energies that are responsible for managing and developing maintenance scheduling solutions internally e.g. Total Digital Factory.
\end{itemize}

I believe an external stay at Decision Brain could greatly improve my personal skills and the future financial value of the project.
I suspect my expertise in designing, scoping, and building scheduling systems will contribute to Decision Brain's knowledge base as well.
