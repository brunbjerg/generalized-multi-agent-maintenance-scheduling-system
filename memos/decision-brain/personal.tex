% WARNING: Dette er meget rodet og svært at følge med i, hvad din pointe er. Du beskriver flere ting, som enten virker lidt random eller ikke færdigøres.
% Fx "I focus on designing systems...", og fortsætter med noget omkring projecthåndtering.
% Jeg ville opbygge det som:
I am an introverted person who prefers few but close partnerships. I would say my greatest strengths are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Very maticulate about understanding the problem thereafter finding the best solution
	\item Creating producing reproducible setups
\end{itemize}

I would say my greatest weaknesess are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item item1
	\item item2
\end{itemize}
 

My hobbies include running (25-30 km per week), reading non-fiction on various topics not directly related to work; 
and engaging in creative coding projects with friends.

Looking ahead, I aspire to advance my career by developing maintenance scheduling systems
either by joining a company like Decision Brain or founding my own company based on the
knowledge that I have gained through the Ph.D. program.
