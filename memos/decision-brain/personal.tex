\section{Personal}

I am an introverted person who prefers few but close partnerships. I would say my greatest strengths are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Care intensly about the quality of the products that I am working on. I will call people out for bad technical decision making and hold people accountable for project decisions.
	\item Maticulate about understanding the problem and afterwards building the best solution.
	\item Creating reliable and automatic systems, whether for coding applications, scripting workflows, creating development setups (Linux and Nix), drafting documents (LaTeX or Typst), etc.
\end{itemize}

I would say my greatest weaknesses are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Communication skills, I usually benefit significantly from a proactive and competent teamleader.
	\item Project management and prioritization is part of my job where I have consistently demonstrated that I have a blindspot.  
\end{itemize}
 
My hobbies include running (25-30 km per week), reading non-fiction on various topics not directly related to work; 
and engaging in creative coding projects with friends.

Looking ahead, I aspire to advance my career by developing maintenance scheduling systems
either by joining a company like Decision Brain or founding my own company based on the
knowledge that I have gained through the Ph.D. program.
