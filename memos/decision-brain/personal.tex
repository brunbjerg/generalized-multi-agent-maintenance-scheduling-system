% WARNING: Dette er meget rodet og svært at følge med i, hvad din pointe er. Du beskriver flere ting, som enten virker lidt random eller ikke færdigøres.
% Fx "I focus on designing systems...", og fortsætter med noget omkring projecthåndtering.
% Jeg ville opbygge det som:
I am an introverted person who prefers few but close partnerships. I would say my greatest strengths are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Very maticulate about understanding the problem thereafter finding the best solution
	\item Creating reliable and automatic systems, whether for coding applications, scripting workflows, drafting documents (LaTeX or Typst), etc.
\end{itemize}

I would say my greatest weaknesess are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Communication skill, I benefit a lot from a proactive and competent teamleader.
	\item Project management and prioritization is part of my job where I have consistently demonstrated that I have a blindspot.  
\end{itemize}
 

My hobbies include running (25-30 km per week), reading non-fiction on various topics not directly related to work; 
and engaging in creative coding projects with friends.

Looking ahead, I aspire to advance my career by developing maintenance scheduling systems
either by joining a company like Decision Brain or founding my own company based on the
knowledge that I have gained through the Ph.D. program.
