\section{Personal}

I am an introverted person who prefers few but close partnerships. To perform at a high level
I benefit immensely from having the right colleagues who provide support and complement the 
qualities I may lack. I focus on designing systems on a higher level, often feeling worried if I 
do not believe that I or my team is working on tasks that are not aligned with our final goals. 
This is good for inspiring and setting direction, but it is clear to me that people with other 
qualities are also needed to make a project work and be successful.

My hobbies include running (25-30 km per week), reading non-fiction on various topics not directly related to work; 
and engaging in creative coding projects with friends.

Looking ahead, I aspire to advance my career by developing maintenance scheduling systems
either by joining a company like Decision Brain or founding my own company based on the
knowledge that I have gained through the Ph.D. program.
