% FIX: MENTION THE NAME OF THE SAP PERSON.
\subsection{Writing to SAP}
I have had disscussions with people in Paris about writing to SAP. Specificially 
asked if it would be possible to write to table AFVC column ABLAD which is the 
column called "Unloading Point". This is posible but it will require all
my source code to be uploaded to Total Energies servers, which I is a little 
bit at odds with the research part of the project as I will lose control over it.

\subsection{Coding on the server side}
Since out last meeting I have done a significant amount of coding on the server side
of the application, most of it is related to the tactical model (The one that schedules)
on the days, to make it dynamic and provide results that are satisfactory. (I think that
Brian can quickly test this when it works as I have basically copied the previous project
for this algorithm).

To reiterate the long term goal here refer to figure~\ref{fig:hexagon:persistence}, \ref{fig:hexagon:metaheuristics}, and \ref{fig:hexagon:userinterfaces}. 

	\input{../../../figures/model-setup-hexagon.tex}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    \drawModelSetupHexagon[userinterface=false, persistence=true, metaheuristics=false]
	\caption{The proposed model setup. The server creates one \textbf{Strategic} algorithm as shown in section~\ref{sec:model:strategic}, 
	on \textbf{Tactical} algorithm as shown in section~\ref{sec:model:tactical}, and 
	one for each \textbf{Supervisor} as shown in section~\ref{sec:model:supervisor}, 
	finally there one model for each \textbf{Technician} as shown in section~\ref{sec:model:technician}}
	\label{fig:hexagon:persistence}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    \drawModelSetupHexagon[userinterface=false, persistence=false, metaheuristics=true]
	\caption{The proposed model setup. The server creates one \textbf{Strategic} algorithm as shown in section~\ref{sec:model:strategic}, 
	on \textbf{Tactical} algorithm as shown in section~\ref{sec:model:tactical}, and 
	one for each \textbf{Supervisor} as shown in section~\ref{sec:model:supervisor}, 
	finally there one model for each \textbf{Technician} as shown in section~\ref{sec:model:technician}}
	\label{fig:hexagon:metaheuristics}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    \drawModelSetupHexagon[userinterface=true, persistence=false, metaheuristics=false]
	\caption{The proposed model setup. The server creates one \textbf{Strategic} algorithm as shown in section~\ref{sec:model:strategic}, 
	on \textbf{Tactical} algorithm as shown in section~\ref{sec:model:tactical}, and 
	one for each \textbf{Supervisor} as shown in section~\ref{sec:model:supervisor}, 
	finally there one model for each \textbf{Technician} as shown in section~\ref{sec:model:technician}}
	\label{fig:hexagon:userinterfaces}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:hexagon} shows a setup where each hexagon is a mathematical model that is optimizing
a certain part of the scheduling process. Where you both have seen a little of the \textbf{Strategic}.
and the \textbf{Tactical}. These models will never be able of their own to model the system as such user-interfaces are 
created for each of these stakeholders.

\section{Academic Papers}
I unfortunately have to write academic papers even though we do not have solid results yet.
I do not like to do it that way but I need to do it do get my Ph.D. degree. The first paper
is called \textbf{Actor-based Large Neighborhood Search}, and I am trying to finish it as 
quickly as possible so that we can get back to testing.


\section{External Stay}
I am going of external stay in Paris at a company called \textbf{Decision Brain} it is a 
company that creates maintenance scheduling software that resembles the kind of system 
that we are trying to develop. I am going there with the intention of learning how to
best proceed with implementing the system that we are working on here at Total.
