\section{Problems and Issues}


\begin{itemize}
	\item "Customer" support
	\item Funding of the project 
	\item Frontend development
\end{itemize}

\subsection{"Customer" Support}
The success of this project relies heavily on the support from you two. I
made the deal with Sebastien Perrier while he was still in Esbjerg that
if I made all the backend code where you two would like the code then his
team would supply the manpower needed to develop the frontends. 

Now the problem is that if I cannot convince the two of you it becomes 
really difficult to making this work. 

\subsection{Funding of the Project}
The funding for the project is running out so I will not be able to 
come to Esbjerg as often as I have been previously. I will try to 
draft a proposal for a project after I come home from Decision Brain,
they have a lot of experience with developing systems like the one that
we are developing together. 

\subsection{Frontend Development}
A correct implementation of the project will require a lot of frontend 
development work, which I do not have time to do alone. I am not use 
how to best solve this issue, especially as I lack the required 
experience to actually know what to ask for. There is also the 
issue that the backend code changes quickly.
