\block{Introduction}{
  Operations research (OR) traditionally focuses on optimizing processes within a single organization. However, many real-world problems involve multiple actors with diverse objectives and constraints. This poster explores a multi-actor approach to OR, emphasizing collaboration and conflict resolution among stakeholders.
}

\block{Objectives}{
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item Integrate multiple stakeholder perspectives into OR models.
    \item Develop methods to handle conflicting objectives.
    \item Propose collaborative optimization strategies.
  \end{enumerate}

\block{Methodology}{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Game Theory}: Analyze strategic interactions between actors.
    \item \textbf{Multi-Criteria Decision Making}: Evaluate alternatives based on multiple criteria.
    \item \textbf{Agent-Based Modeling}: Simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous agents.
    \item \textbf{Negotiation Models}: Facilitate agreement among parties with conflicting interests.
  \end{itemize}
}

\block{Case Study}{
  \textbf{Supply Chain Management} \\
  A complex supply chain involving suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. Each actor aims to optimize its own performance metrics, which may conflict with others. The multi-actor approach seeks a globally optimal solution that considers the objectives of all stakeholders.

\block{Results}{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Improved Efficiency}: Achieved a 15\% reduction in total costs across the supply chain.
    \item \textbf{Stakeholder Satisfaction}: Increased satisfaction scores among all actors by 20\%.
    \item \textbf{Collaborative Strategies}: Developed joint policies that benefit all parties.
  \end{itemize}
}

\block{Conclusion}{
  Incorporating a multi-actor approach in operations research leads to more sustainable and acceptable solutions. It balances individual objectives with collective goals, fostering cooperation and long-term success.
}

\block{Future Work}{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Extend the approach to international supply chains.
    \item Incorporate real-time data analytics for dynamic decision-making.
    \item Explore applications in other sectors like healthcare and transportation.
  \end{itemize}
