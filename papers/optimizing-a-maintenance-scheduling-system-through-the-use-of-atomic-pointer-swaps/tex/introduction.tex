\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
This paper will be structured into four sections: Section~\ref{sec:introduction} will explain the
problem setting that necessitates the solution method; describe the relevant software architecture
literature to fix the problem; and provide mathematical models for each component of the system for 
a detailed understanding of the problem that the optimization system aims to solve. Section~\ref{sec:solution_method}
will describe the chosen approach to solve the system, highlighting why low-level memory operations
are necessary to effective scale metaheuristics. Section~\ref{sec:results} will provide a high level
understanding of how the system is behaving. Finally Section~\ref{sec:discussion} will discuss the 
implication of the provided solution approach and which other optimization problems could benefit 
from the presented optimization approach.

\subsection{Problem Setting}
Many operational optimzation problems are difficult to solve in practice as the underlying business 
process is made up of many different actors. This makes single model approaches difficult as it is 
difficult to assign responsibility for the output of the solution provided by the optimization
approach \citep{INTERACTIVEOPTIMIZATION}. Furthermore this decomposition of business process into 
specific actors is not only done to make the underlying optimization problem easier to solve, but 
also to handle dynamic changes in the optimization process and make each process compliant with 
respect to safety, regulation, etc. 

Maintenance scheduling has all these components and it is one of the keys reasons that the presented
solution method was developed.

\subsection{Software Architecture}
Metaheuristics present unique challenges when it comes to designing a high level software architecture
where the metaheuristics can be reliably implemented and scale. One of the reasons for this is that 
metaheuristics have very high requirements when it comes to state mutation. State mutation is the 
primary way in which metaheuristics achieve optimization by changing the solution space rapidly
according to special rules \citep{gendreauHandbookMetaheuristics2019}. 

If you want to scale metaheuristics if becomes necessary to determine a software architecture that 
can accomodate high levels of state changes. Most attempts at this has centered around message
passing \citep{talbiMetaheuristicsDesignImplementation2009} and in more advanced setup might 
also incorporate methods from the multi-agent systems literature to 
speed up the optimization process \citep{MultiagentMetaheuristicOptimization}.

This paper will present a different way of scaling metaheuristics using low-level memory operations
such as atomic operations. \citep{!!! CITE THE LOCK FREE DATA STRUCTURE ARTICLE}.

\subsection{Mathematical Models}
Each actor of the maintenance scheduling process will here be modelled by a mathematical model. There
are multiple driving ideas behind these approaches:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A model should encapsulate the decision that a single decision-maker is responsible for and
		nothing more
	\item Coordination between different actors is done by sharing relevant information 
		by turning the solution of one actor/model into parameters of the other model.
\end{itemize}
