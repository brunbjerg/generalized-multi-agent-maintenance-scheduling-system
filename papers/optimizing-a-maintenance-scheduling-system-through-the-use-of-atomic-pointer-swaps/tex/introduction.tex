\section{Introduction}


The future research direction is to demonstrate that
the actor-based approach described here can be used to model and optimize 
multi-actor/multi-level scheduling processes. 
Figures~\ref{fig:ordinator-hexagon:persistence},
~\ref{fig:ordinator-hexagon:atomicpointerswap},
~\ref{fig:ordinator-hexagon:metaheuristics},
~\ref{fig:ordinator-hexagon:orchestrator},
~\ref{fig:ordinator-hexagon:userinterfaces}
show a larger scale setup of the actor-based approach which is being developed with Total Energies.
Here figure~\ref{fig:ordinator-hexagon:metaheuristics}
shows the metaheuristics of scheduling system architecture where each of the actors run an AbLNS
and that each metaheuristic will share its solutions with the other
metaheuristics through atomic pointer swapping shown in figure~\ref{fig:ordinator-hexagon:atomicpointerswap}.
Communicate with the end-user
through userinterfaces and message passing as shown in figure~\ref{fig:ordinator-hexagon:userinterfaces}, 
integrate with a persistent storage through mutex
locks as shown in figure~\ref{fig:ordinator-hexagon:persistence}, 
and the lifecycle of each of the metaheuristics will be controlled by
the orchestrator also through message passing as shown in figure~\ref{fig:ordinator-hexagon:orchestrator}.
