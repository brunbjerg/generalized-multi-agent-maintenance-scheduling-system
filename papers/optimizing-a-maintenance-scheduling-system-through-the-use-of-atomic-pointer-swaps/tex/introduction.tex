\subsection{Problem Setting}


\subsection{Software Architecture}
Metaheuristics present unique challenges when it comes to designing a high level software architecture
where the metaheuristics can be reliably implemented and scale. One of the reasons for this is that 
metaheuristics have very high requirements when it comes to state mutation. State mutation is the 
primary way in which metaheuristics achieve optimization by changing the solution space rapidly
according to special rules \citep{han}
