                scheduling---thoroughly revised for the latest advancesWritten by
                a Certified Maintenance and Reliability Professional (CMRP) with
                more than three decades of experience, this resource provides
                proven planning and scheduling strategies that will take any
                maintenance organization to the next level of performance. The
                book resolves common industry frustration with planning and
                reduces the complexity of scheduling in addition to dealing with
                reactive maintenance. You will find coverage of estimating labor
                hours, setting the level of plan detail, creating practical
                weekly and daily schedules, kitting parts, and more, all designed
                to increase your workforce without hiring. Much of the text
                applies the timeless management principles of Dr. W. Edwards
                Deming and Dr. Peter F. Drucker. You will learn how you can do
                more proactive work when your hands are full of reactive
                work.Maintenance Planning and Scheduling Handbook, Fourth Edition
                , features more new case studies showing real world successes, a
                new chapter on getting better storeroom support, major revisions
                that describe the best KPIs for planning, major additions to the
                issue of ``selling'' planning to gain support, revisions to make
                work order codes more useful, a new appendix on numerically
                auditing planning success, and a new appendix devoted entirely to
                selecting a great maintenance planner.Maintenance Planning and

                comprehensive overview of software architecture's many aspects.
                Aspiring and existing architects alike will examine architectural
                characteristics, architectural patterns, component determination,
                diagramming and presenting architecture, evolutionary
