\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:4-discussion}
Maintenance scheduling efficiently solves a complex scheduling problem by
the use of multiple actors. Through the use of actors the  process handles
uncertainty that is difficult to reason about, using models with different
levels of aggregation where each actors understands how to exploit his model.
As uncertainties manifest themselves the actors/models handle the uncertainty
through  communication. To further understand the implications of the approach
the discussion will be divided into three sections: 1. actors and  integration;
2. continuous optimization allows asynchronous optimization; 3. future research.

\subsection{Actors \& Integration}
Often in operation research the failure to reliably solve operational problems in 
industry are not due to the problems being computationally intractable \cite{gendreauHandbookMetaheuristics2019} but a
practical problem of connecting data streams so that the solution approach continually
receives dynamic data to handle changes and then afterwards connecting the resulting solutions
to the relevant stakeholders (actors) through a relevant interface \cite{meignanReviewTaxonomyInteractive2015}.
The actor-based approach  proposed in this paper makes integration easier by
naturally encapsulating a model with a reliable interface. 

\subsection{Continuous Optimization}
With actor-based metaheuristics the optimization loop can run 
indefinitely optimizing based on the latest available information. This may seem like a detail as you could argue that you should only ever optimize the schedule when there is 
an explicit need for it, but consider the case when you start adding more than two actor to a scheduling system, then there arises a need
to coordinate people in time as each will have to run their optimizer on after another.

\subsection{Future Research}
The primary future research of this project is to demonstrate that the system described here can be 
used to model and optimize larger scale scheduling processes. A possible extension here is shown in
\ref{fig:ordinator-architecture} where each of 
the actors run a metaheuristic and that each metaheuristic will shared its solutions with the 
other metaheuristics through atomic pointer swapping. Communicate with the end-user through message
passing, integrate with a persistence storage through mutex locks, and the lifecycle of each of the 
metaheuristics will be controlled by the orchestrator through message passing.
