\section{Results}\label{sec:3-results}
To test the AbLNS algorithm, several simulations are conducted in which the data
is perturbed during the algorithmâ€™s execution. The data from the
company is presented in Section~\ref{sec:data_instance}. Then the effect of
forcing work orders into specific weekly $\ElementPeriod \in \SetPeriod$
schedules is presented in Section~\ref{sec:response_work_orders} and excluding
work orders from periods is presented in Section~\ref{sec:exclusion}. The
effects of reducing the period resource capacities $\ParStrategicResource$ is
tested in Section~\ref{sec:results:reduced_weekly_capacity} and increasing
$\ElementResource$ is tested in  Section~\ref{sec:increase_week_cap}. Finally
the effect of changing the work order values $\ParStrategicUrgency$, is tested
in Section~\ref{sec:results:strategic_value_changes}.

\subsection{Data Instance}\label{sec:data_instance}
The data instance used in this paper is provided by Total
Energies~\citep{total-energies} and extracted from their SAP ERP system. It
pertains to a specific offshore platform and covers a two-year time horizon. The
instance includes 3,487 outstanding work orders ($\SetWorkOrder{}$), 16 distinct
resource skill sets ($\SetResource$) (e.g., mechanics, electricians, turbine
specialists, etc.), and spans 52 bi-weekly periods ($\SetPeriod$), roughly
equivalent to two years.

\subsection{Value of Objective Function Parameters}
The optimization problem has three terms and it could be argued that the
a pareto front should be calculated on the value of the different weightings
between them. To not lose sight of the main contribution of the paper the
value of the $\ParClusteringValue$ and
$\ParStrategicResourcePenalty$ has been set so
that the $\ParStrategicResourcePenalty$ always dominates the $\ParStrategicUrgency$ and
that the $\ParStrategicUrgency$ always dominates the $\ParClusteringValue$.
Furthermore the $\ParClusteringValue$ has been excluded from the results section
to put more focus on the user-input interaction.

\subsection{Response to Inclusion of Work Orders}\label{sec:response_work_orders}
The $\ParStrategicInclude$ parameter specifies whether a work order
should be scheduled into a specific period. As the parameter has the time
variable $\VarMetaTime$ it means that this parameter can change at any time
while the metaheuristic is running. The $\ParStrategicInclude$ parameter
constrains the model in equation~\ref{eqn:constraint:strategic:include}.
Table~\ref{tab:responses:inclusion} shows the responses that the model will be
subject to while it is running for different timepoints $\VarMetaTime$.

\input{./tables/inclusion-table.tex}

Figure~\ref{fig:responses:inclusion} shows the effects of changing the $
\ParStrategicInclude$ parameter in real-time. The model quickly converges
and when the system is pertubed by an input response the objective 
value~\ref{eqn:objective:strategic} shows a small spike and then quickly converges to
a new solution.

	}
	\caption{At each 60 second time interval the the solution is perturbed by forcing work orders into specific
		periods. Here the strategic urgency fluctuatues as the dominating term of the strategic resource penalty
		is minimized.
	}\label{fig:responses:inclusion}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:responses:inclusion}  show 5 perturbations with the first
at $\tau = 60s$ where the objective value slightly increases in response to
the inclusion, the objective value increases due to the inclusion either
causing the capacity to be exceeded or the inclusion resulting in a selected
$ \ParStrategicUrgency$ that has a higher value. The remaining 4 perturbations
all show the same  pattern, an increase in the strategic urgency and
resource penalty  followed by a subsequent convergence.

\subsection{Response to Exclusion}\label{sec:exclusion}
The response to exclusion is associated with the $\ParStrategicExclude$
parameter and is found in equation~\ref{eqn:strategic:constraint:exclude}.
Here specific work orders ($\ElementWorkOrder \in \SetWorkOrder{}$) are
being excluded from specific periods ($\ElementPeriod \in \SetPeriod$).
The perturbations that the AbLNS will be affected by are shown in
table~\ref{tab:responses:exclusion}
with the setup being very similar to the
one in table~\ref{tab:responses:inclusion}.
The main distinction being that the perturbation affects 500 instead of 50 work orders, the higher number 
of affected work orders is chosen as many exclusions of do not affect the assignment of a work order.

\input{./tables/exclusion-table.tex}

Figure~\ref{fig:responses:exclusion}  show a substantial spike in the strategic urgency
and a substantial decrease in the strategic resource penalty   
after each perturbation as given by table~\ref{tab:responses:exclusion}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\resizebox{10cm}{!}{
		\input{figures/strategic_objective_value_exclusion_plot.tex}
	}
	\caption{At each 60 second interval the strategic urgency experiences a 
		large spike as urgent work order are being forced to be scheduled further out.
		The strategic resource penalty in lowered as $\ParStrategicInclude$ parameters
		and corresponding constraints are removed 
	}\label{fig:responses:exclusion}
\end{figure}

From figure~\ref{fig:responses:inclusion} and figure~\ref{fig:responses:exclusion} it is 
clear that the AbLNS method can handle dynamic entries of work orders. The next section will discuss the effects of dynamically changing the 
resource capacities $\ParStrategicResource$. 

\subsection{Response to Additional Weekly Capacity}\label{sec:increase_week_cap}
Table~\ref{tab:responses:resource-addition} details the perturbations that the
AbLNS will be subject to during its 360 second execution. Perturbing the
$\ParStrategicResource$ affects the solution considerably more than
perturbing $\ParStrategicExclude$ and $\ParStrategicInclude$ and therefore 100
second intervals are specified instead of 60 second intervals.

\input{./tables/resource-addition-table.tex}

Figure~\ref{fig:responses:resources-addition} shows the effects of progressively
increasing  available resources. The AbLNS starts with an initial load which is
then increased at $\tau = 100$ seconds causing the objective value to decrease
as $\VarStrategicExcess$ in equation~\ref{eqn:strategic:constraint:resource}
can achieve a lower value. At $\tau = 200$ the resources are increased
to their final value.

	\caption{Starting from an initial load of 61816 hours. The resources are increased causing a drop in the
		objective value and the AbLNS then optimizes around the perturbation
	}\label{fig:responses:resources-addition}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Response to Reduced Weekly Capacity}\label{sec:results:reduced_weekly_capacity}
Table~\ref{tab:resources:resource-subtraction} details the perturbations that the
AbLNS will affected by. Starting from an initial amount of available
resource, the resources are progressively decreased.

\input{./tables/resource-subtraction-table.tex}

Figure~\ref{fig:responses:resource-subtraction} shows the effects of perturbing
the AbLNS by starting from an initial load and then progressively reducing
capacity.

\begin{figure}[H]%% placement specifier

	\resizebox{10cm}{!}{

	\caption{Starting from an initial load of 173083 total hours the AbLNS is 
		progressively affected by decreasing levels of resources. The AbLNS is pertubed by two decreases
		in resources causing an initial spike in the objective value followed 
		by the AbLNS optimizing around the perturbation
	}\label{fig:responses:resource-subtraction}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Response to Changes in Work Order Values}\label{sec:results:strategic_value_changes}
The final parameter that will be changed is the work order urgency parameter
$\ParStrategicUrgency$. Table~\ref{tab:responses:urgency-change} details the
perturbations that the AbLNS will by affected by. On each iteration 100 work
orders are having their values changed by the amount  shown in the 4th row of
table~\ref{tab:responses:urgency-change}.

\input{./tables/urgency-change-table.tex}

Figure~\ref{fig:responses:value_change} shows the effects of
perturbing the AbLNS by changing the $\ParStrategicUrgency$ parameter in the objective
function~\ref{eqn:objective:strategic} which specifies the value of assigning a
work order to a specific period.
