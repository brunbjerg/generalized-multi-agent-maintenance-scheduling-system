\section{Results}\label{sec:3-results}
To test the AbLNS algorithm a number of simulations are performed where the
data are perturbed during the AbLNS algorithm execution The data from the
company is presented in Section~\ref{sec:data_instance}. Then the effect of
forcing work orders into specific weekly  $\ElementPeriod \in \SetPeriod$
schedules is presented in Section~\ref{sec:response_work_orders}  and excluding
work orders from periods is presented in Section~\ref{sec:exclusion}. The
effects of reducing the period resource capacities $\ParStrategicResource$ is
tested in Section~\ref{sec:results:reduced_weekly_capacity} and increasing $
\ElementResource$ is tested in  Section~\ref{sec:increase_week_cap}.  Finally
the effect of changing the work order values $\ParStrategicUrgency$,  is tested
in Section~\ref{sec:results:strategic_value_changes}.

\subsection{Data Instance}\label{sec:data_instance}
This data instance is provided by Total Energies~\citep{total-energies}. The data
is extracted from their SAP ERP system.  The data instance used in this paper
is from a specific offshore platform that for  the 2 year time horizon contains
3487 outstanding work orders ($\SetWorkOrder{}$), have 16 different resource
skill sets ($\SetResource$) (e.g.\ mechanics, electricians,  turbine specialists,
etc.), and finally the scheduling horizon stretches over a 52 bi-weekly periods
($\SetPeriod$) meaning approximately 2 years.

\subsection{Response to Inclusion of Work Orders}\label{sec:response_work_orders}
The $\ParStrategicInclude$ parameter specifies whether a work order
should be scheduled into a specific period. As the parameter has the time
variable $\VarMetaTime$ it means that this parameter can change at any time
while the metaheuristic is running. The $\ParStrategicInclude$ parameter
constrains the model in equation~\ref{eqn:constraint:strategic:include}.
Table~\ref{tab:responses:inclusion} shows the responses that the model will be
subject to while it is running for different timepoints $\VarMetaTime$.

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
	\toprule
	                                & $\VarMetaTime_1 = 60$ & $\VarMetaTime_2 = 120$ & $\VarMetaTime_3 = 180$ & $\VarMetaTime_4 = 240$ & $\VarMetaTime_5 = 300$ \\ \midrule
	$\Delta |\ParStrategicInclude|$ & 50                    & 50                     & 50                     & 50                     & 50                     \\ \bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{The including work orders perturbations that the AbLNS will be affected by. 
		Perturbations occur at 60 second time intervals affecting 50 randomly chosen work orders included into random periods.
	}\label{tab:responses:inclusion}
\end{table}

Figure~\ref{fig:responses:inclusion} shows the effects of changing the $
\ParStrategicInclude$ parameter in real-time. The model quickly converges
and when the system is pertubed by an input response the objective 
value~\ref{eqn:objective:strategic} shows a small spike and then quickly converges to
a new solution.

	}
	\caption{Effects of perturbing the solution by forcing work orders into specific
		periods.
	}\label{fig:responses:inclusion}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:responses:inclusion}  show 5 perturbations with the first
at time = 60s where the objective value  slightly increases in response to
the inclusion, the objective value increases due to the inclusion either
causing the capacity to be exceeded or the inclusion resulting in a selected
$ \ParStrategicUrgency$ that has a lower value. The remaining 4 perturbations
all show the same  pattern, an increase in the objective value followed by
a subsequent convergence. Notice that despite the convergence, the objective
after convergence is higher. This is to be expected, since forcing specific
workorders into specific weeks constrains the optimization problem more.

\subsection{Response to Exclusion}\label{sec:exclusion}
The response to exclusion is associated with the $\ParStrategicExclude$
parameter and is found in equation~\ref{eqn:strategic:constraint:exclude}.
Here specific work orders ($\ElementWorkOrder \in \SetWorkOrder{}$) are
being excluded from specific periods ($\ElementPeriod \in \SetPeriod$).
The perturbations that the AbLNS will be affected by are shown in
table~\ref{tab:responses:exclusion}
with the setup being very similar to the
one in table~\ref{tab:responses:inclusion}.
The main distinction being that the perturbation affects 500 instead of 50 work orders, the higher number 
of affected work orders is chosen as many exclusions of do not affect the assignment of a work order.

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
	\toprule
	                                & $\VarMetaTime_1 = 60$ & $\VarMetaTime_2 = 120$ & $\VarMetaTime_3 = 180$ & $\VarMetaTime_4 = 240$ & $\VarMetaTime_5 = 300$ \\ \midrule
	$\Delta |\ParStrategicExclude|$ & 500                   & 500                    & 500                    & 500                    & 500                    \\ \bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{The exclusion of work orders perturbations from specific periods on the weekly schedule. 
		Perturbations occur at 60 second time intervals affecting 500 work orders each time.
	}\label{tab:responses:exclusion}
\end{table}

Figure~\ref{fig:responses:exclusion}  show a substantial spike in the objective value  
after a perturbation as given in table~\ref{tab:responses:exclusion}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\resizebox{10cm}{!}{
		\input{figures/strategic_objective_value_exclusion_plot.tex}
	}
	\caption{At each 60 second interval the objective value experiences a 
	large spike as the exclusion of work orders make the current best
	assignment of work orders infeasible}\label{fig:responses:exclusion}
\end{figure}

From figure~\ref{fig:responses:inclusion} and figure~\ref{fig:responses:exclusion} it is 
clear that the AbLNS method can handle dynamic entries of work orders. The next section will discuss the effects of dynamically changing the 
resource capacities $\ParStrategicResource$. 

\subsection{Response to Additional Weekly Capacity}\label{sec:increase_week_cap}
Table~\ref{tab:responses:resource-addition} details the perturbations that the
AbLNS will be subject to during its 360 second execution. Perturbing the
resources $\ParStrategicResource$ affects the solution considerably more than
perturbing $\ParStrategicExclude$ and $\ParStrategicInclude$ and therefore 100
second intervals are specified instead of 60 second intervals.

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
	\toprule
	                                    & $\VarMetaTime_1 = 0$ & $\VarMetaTime_1 = 100$ & $\VarMetaTime_2 = 200$ & $\VarMetaTime_3 = 300$ \\ \midrule
	$\Delta |\SetPeriod|$               & 52                   & 52                     & 52                     & 52                     \\ \midrule
	$\Delta |\SetResource|$             & 16                   & 16                     & 16                     & 16                     \\ \midrule
	$ |\ParStrategicResource{}|$ (hours)& 111268               &  61816                 & 111268                 & 173083                 \\ \bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{The resource perturbations that the AbLNS will be affected by measured in hours. Here all $\ElementPeriod \in \SetPeriod$ and $\ElementResource \in \SetResource$ are 
		affected
	}\label{tab:responses:resource-addition}
\end{table}

Figure~\ref{fig:responses:resources-addition} shows the effects of progressively
increasing  available resources. The AbLNS starts with a base load which is
then reduced at time = 100 seconds causing the objective value to increase
as $\ParStrategicResourcePenalty$ in equation~\ref{eqn:strategic:constraint:resource}
absorbs the exceeded capacity. At time = 200 the resources are increased to the
base load again, and at time = 300 seconds the resources are increased to their
final value.

		optimize around the perturbation

\subsection{Response to Reduced Weekly Capacity}\label{sec:results:reduced_weekly_capacity}
Table~\ref{tab:resources:resource-subtraction} details the perturbations that the
AbLNS will affected by. Starting from a base load of the amount of available
resources are progressively decreased.

the AbLNS by starting from a base load  and then progressively reducing
capacity.

\subsection{Response to Changes in Work Order Values}\label{sec:results:strategic_value_changes}
The final parameter that will be changed is the work order value $
\ParStrategicUrgency$. Table~\ref{tab:responses:value_change} details the
perturbations that the AbLNS will by affected by. On each iteration 100 work
orders are having their values changed by the amount  shown in the 4th row of
table~\ref{tab:responses:value_change}.
