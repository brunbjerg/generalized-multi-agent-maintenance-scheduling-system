\section{Solution Method}\label{sec:2-solution-method}

\subsection{Actor-based Large Neighborhood Search} 
A metaheuristic that is affected by the end user and requires real-time
feedback inherently requires an optimization approach that is able to repair
infeasible solutions while also converging quickly. The large neighborhood
search (LNS)~\citep{shaw1998using} metaheuristic has been shown satisfy these
requirements in the literature \citep{gendreauHandbookMetaheuristics2019}.
The most general form of the LNS metaheuristic is defined for static
problems, meaning that the parameters that make up the problem instance
is not subject to change after the algorithm has started. To make the
LNS adapt to changing parameters in real-time a message system have been
implemented into the existing framework. This  extension is shown in 
algorithm~\ref{alg:actor-based-large-neighborhood-search}.

\subsubsection{Messages and Destructors}
LNS in its most basic form has one constructor and one destructor which
repeatedly destroy and rebuild the solution. For the AbLNS we will
generalize on this concept by including messages as destructors. This
generalization can be seen as being somewhat similar to how the adaptive
LNS (ALNS)~\citep{pisinger2007general} is formulated, but where the different
constructors and destructors are also chosen from sources external to the
algorithm.

Extending on the classic setup we define the following set of 
destructor messages, $\ElementMessage{}{} \in \SetMessageQueue$. Each
message is received by the system at time $\VarMetaTime \in \mathbb{R}$.

\begin{itemize}
	\item $m^{wp}_{1}(\VarMetaTime)$: Inclusion destruct message, modifies $\ParStrategicInclude$	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each instance of this message unschedules a particular work order and then it forces
			it to be scheduled into the period specified by $\ParStrategicInclude$. If a
			specific work order was already assigned to a period then $\ParStrategicInclude$ is set
			to zero, making sure that constraint~\ref{eqn:constraint:strategic:schedule_once}
			is not violated for that $\ElementPeriod \in \SetPeriod$ and $\ElementWorkOrder \in \SetWorkOrder$. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item $m^{wp}_{2}(\VarMetaTime)$: Exclusion destruct message, modifies $\ParStrategicExclude$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each instance of this message excludes a work order from a specific set of periods.
			If a specific work order is already included in a specific period $\ElementPeriod$ by 
			constraint~\ref{eqn:constraint:strategic:include}
			this message will set the $\ParStrategicExclude$ to zero removing the effect of the constraint 
			for that $\ElementPeriod \in \SetPeriod$ and $\ElementWorkOrder \in \SetWorkOrder$. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item $m^{pr}_{3}(\VarMetaTime)$: Capacities destruct message, modifies $\ParStrategicResource$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each instance of this message perturbes the value of available hours of a given resource $\ElementResource \in \SetResource$ for
			a given $\ElementPeriod \in \SetPeriod$.
	\end{itemize}
	\item $m^{wp}_{4}(\VarMetaTime)$: Strategic urgency destruct message, modifies $\ParStrategicUrgency$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each instance of this message perturbes the strategic urgency of a work order. Here it should be noted that the
			message changes the $\ParStrategicUrgency$ of every $\ElementPeriod \in \SetPeriod$ for a given $\ElementWorkOrder \in \SetWorkOrder$. $\ElementPeriod$. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item $m^{wk}_{5}(\VarMetaTime)$: Random destruct message, modifies $\VarStrategicWorkOrderAssignment{\ElementWorkOrder}{\ElementPeriod}$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each instance of this message modifies the main decision variable, $\VarStrategicWorkOrderAssignment{\ElementWorkOrder}{\ElementPeriod}$. 
			Removing random work order assignments from $k$ randomly chosen $\ElementWorkOrder \in \SetWorkOrder$, where $k \in \mathbb{N}$ is a parameter of the AbLNS.	
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Each of these messages affect different parts of the weekly maintenance
scheduling  problem. Notice here that the first four messages destruct the
solution by changing the parameter space and the last message is a random
destructor that destroys the solution space.

For a correct implementation it is critical that the that destruct messages
are  handled one by one, and are not allowed to simply write to the solution and
problem instance whenever they appear. Generalizing the destructors from being
static structures into messages allows the solution to change in real-time to a
changing parameter space. This means that the algorithm does not need to restart
to handle changes in data.

\input{../../tex/algorithms/actor-based-large-neighborhood-search}

The basic LNS setup have here been extended with a ``message queue'' $
\MessageQueue$. The message queue will be read from on every iteration of
the LNS's main iteration loop. Here we notice that the incoming message is
able to change both the solution $\Solution$ but also the problem instance $
\ProblemInstance$ itself. Due to the inherent property of LNS being able to
optimize a solution that have become infeasible, LNS is well suited to handle
changing parameters  in the problem instance $\ProblemInstance$. Another
property of the message queue is  that the algorithm can run indefinitely and
as opposed to restarting the algorithm you pass messages containing new data
and/or state. This property avoids the time consuming initial convergence as the
algorithm will be found in an optimized state when the solution is perturbed.
Notice that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The algorithm responds quickly to changes. In each iteration
		line~\ref{alg:actor-based-large-neighborhood-search:message-loop}. We
		call this a fine-grained response algorithm     
	\item If an improved
		solution is found, it is immediately being pushed to the persistence
		on line~\ref{alg:actor-based-large-neighborhood-search:better-solution}
	\item That the optimization occurs in the repair function on
		line~\ref{alg:actor-based-large-neighborhood-search:repair},
		which inserts work orders using a greedy algorithm.  	
	\item The atomic pointer swapping that is performed on
		line~\ref{alg:actor-based-large-neighborhood-search:atomic-pointer-swap} when a
		new best solution is found instantaneously makes the solution available to other
		actors/systems. The pointer swapping is crucial as it allows non-hierarchical
		model setups.
\end{itemize}

The AbLNS algorithm will continuously run, either optimizing the current
schedule or updating the schedule with new external input. Since the
effects of a message is considered in every iteration, changing conditions
will immediately get acted upon. Since a fast response is paramount, exact
optimization algorithms are deemed unworkable.

\subsection{Atomic Pointer Swapping and Software Architecture}
Atomic pointer swapping offers a novel approach for managing the best
solution found by the Actor-based Large Neighborhood Search (AbLNS) algorithm.
Traditionally, in a metaheuristics such as Large Neighborhood Search (LNS)
setup, the best solution is cloned (deep copy) before the search continues. However, atomic
pointer swapping enables the best solution to be shared across system components
without introducing data races. This technique is essential in multithreaded
environments, as it ensures the integrity of the solution during swaps. In
software architecture, scaling is often achieved through vertical scaling
(lengthening the dataflow) and horizontal scaling (increasing throughput)
via message passing. While effective in many domains, this approach poses
challenges for metaheuristics, which rely on rapid state mutations and solution
improvements.

Message passing in metaheuristics can create unpredictable behaviors, especially
with bidirectional communication between components and metaheuristics. The
limitations of message-passing systems in metaheuristics are well-documented,
particularly in the context of parallel and multi-agent metaheuristics
\citep{talbiMetaheuristicsDesignImplementation2009}. These systems often suffer
from excessive message generation, leading to poor scalability, explainability,
extendability, and performance. Key issues include:

\begin{itemize} 
	\item The stochastic nature
		of metaheuristics makes message-passing behavior unpredictable. 
	\item Using message passing often necessitates a
		hierarchical setup, as bidirectional message flows often results in cycles. 
	\item The
		impact of additional types messages is difficult to understand and analyze. 
\end{itemize}

Atomic pointer swapping addresses these challenges by eliminating state
duplication, reducing system complexity, and bypassing the inefficiencies of
message passing. This method provides a streamlined, modular way to integrate
metaheuristics, aligning with modern software architecture principles while
avoiding their typical pitfalls \citep{richards_fundamentals_2020}. It should
be noted that message passing is exceptional at dealing with one-off events that
have varied and sporatic nature such as interfacing with actors and external
systems.
