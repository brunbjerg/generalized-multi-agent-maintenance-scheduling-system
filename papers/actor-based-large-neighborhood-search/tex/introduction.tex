\section{Introduction}
Maintenance scheduling is part of a class of operational problems that have proven hard to solve in practice (NP-hard~\citep{garey1979computers}).
Furthermore, for optimization to be useful in dynamic and uncertain environments where maintenance scheduling 
is performed requires tight integration into existing IT infrastructure to allow the  tacit knowledge of decision makers to influence
the planning process easily. Often a number of different decision makers at different company levels take part in the
planning process. In this way the industry usually assigns responsibility for decision-making to an individual
representing only a small part of the complete process. These multiple smaller planning processes are often difficult
to map to a single mathematical model describing the whole system as elaborated by~\citep{barthelemy2002human}. Solving
operation research problems that are operational in nature have additional requirements over more typical static
problems: they have to be responsive to changing parameters; able to be assimilated into the decision-makers workflow;
allow for integration with dynamic data sources such as databases and APIs~\citep{meignan_review_2015}. Operational
aspects of operation research, as opposed to higher level strategic and tactical ones, are characterized by extensive
amounts coordination and negotiation on proposed schedules often in a short amount of time.

The lack of integration into the schedulers and supervisors workflow and lack of responsiveness can lead to a situation 
where solutions are not directly implemented in practice but instead only provides initial suggestions~\citep{meignan_review_2015}.
Theses initial suggestions are then iterated on elsewhere in the scheduling process usually through much more manual means. 
In~\citep{barthelemy2002human} the authors argue that many problems that operation research aim to solve are often composed
of a group of individuals whose decisions are consolidated into an "epistemic subject" for which a mathematical model can be formulated
and solved, with many scheduling problems being good examples. However often multiple actors have different
views on what constitutes an optimal schedule hence resulting in multiple-objectives. Even if multi-objective
optimization~\citep{ehrgott2002multiple} is applied to find a Pareto Front~\citep{Pareto1897} a negotiating process
still is needed between the actors to select the final schedule. 

This paper proposes a solution method that will allow for real-time optimization
based on actor/user interaction and connection to a dynamic data source,
effectively managing the changes to the parameter space as they occur. The proposed solution
method will be tested on the weekly maintenance scheduling problem \citet{palmerMaintenancePlanningScheduling2019} 
which closely resembles a variant of the multi-compartment multi-knapsack problem (MCMKP). It
should be noted that the scientific maintenance scheduling literature deviates
significantly from its practical implementation which is also detailed in
\citep{palmerMaintenancePlanningScheduling2019}. The solution method is
based on the large neighborhood search (LNS) metaheuristic. LNS 
was chosen due to its properties of naturally being able to work with and fix
infeasible solutions and its state of the art performance on various scheduling
problems \citep{gendreauHandbookMetaheuristics2019}. 

To understand the need for actor-based methods some
background knowledge will be required about the maintenance scheduling process.
In figure \ref{fig:integrated:maintenance-process} illustrates the general setup
of a maintenance planning and scheduling system. The system's actors
have the following responsibilities: the planner generates the work orders that
are to be scheduled; the scheduler creates weekly schedules based on a knapsack
formulation; based on the weekly schedule the supervisor assigns work order
activities that the work order is composed of (the assignment problem); the
technicians executes the work in sequential pattern (single machine scheduling).

A final point on the necessity of actor-based approaches to model such a setup
is the idea of ownership of a work order. Throughout the scheduling process a
work order is owned by a specific actor and he alone is allow to modify/execute it. This
means that a single model approach is very difficult to implement in practice
as a work order is modelled differently depending on the actor that currently
owns it. This also highlight another an point in maintenance scheduling: that
the stochastic nature of the maintenance scheduling process can be handled using
a change of model each with different levels of aggregation and different sets
of constraints, opposed to more academic approaches such as fuzzy logic and
stochastic optimization. When the inherrent uncertainties manifest themselves
during planning or execution, work orders are rescheduled by moving between
the different actors, meaning that the stochastic elements of maintenance
scheduling are handled by \textbf{dynamic rescheduling between the actors}.

This article has the following contribution:
\begin{itemize}
	\item To provide a modular scalable optimization component based on the large neighborhood search metaheuristic that will allow business processes to be composed from smaller units of implementing mathematical models, instead of larger integrated formulations.
\end{itemize}

The paper is divided into four different sections. Section \ref{sec:2-solution-method} explains the weekly maintenance scheduling model in detail and forms the foundation of the paper. Section \ref{sec:3-results} shows that results coming from the implemented system where the implementation will be affected by simulated user-interaction. Section \ref{sec:4-discussion} will discuss the implications of the research and possible future research directions.

\subsection{The Weekly Maintenance Scheduling Model}
A company performing maintenance needs to create weekly maintenance plans for
the next $\ElementPeriod \in \SetPeriod$ weeks. The weekly schedule is created
centrally and consists of scheduling the $\ElementWorkOrder \in \SetWorkOrder$
work orders, i.e. maintenance tasks, such that all $\ElementWorkOrder$
are scheduled into a specific week $\ElementPeriod$. Each work order $
\ElementWorkOrder$ requires some resources $\ElementResource \in \SetResource$
to be carried out, e.g. man-power with different qualifications. Each of these
resources are available in limited amounts $\ParStrategicResource$. To correct
for possible manual interventions that can make the problem infeasible a penalty
$\ParStrategicPenalty$ is introduced. The urgency of the different maintenance operations
varies and is reflected in a penalty for carrying out a maintenance work
order in a certain week given by $\ParStrategicValue$. The $\ParStrategicValue$ also 
captures the tardiness of the individual work orders $\ElementWorkOrder$, meaning that
the value gained from scheduling work orders late is decreasing. Urgent tasks have
increasingly less value the the larger that the week $\ElementPeriod$ becomes. 
Furthermore, two sets exists which will either require work order $\ElementWorkOrder$ to be carried
out in week $\ElementPeriod$ or not carried out in week $\ElementPeriod$ 
These sets are $(\ElementWorkOrder,\ElementPeriod) \in
\ParStrategicInclude$ for inclusion and  $(\ElementWorkOrder, \ElementPeriod) \in
\ParStrategicExclude$ for exclusion. The weekly maintenance scheduling model for the problem 
is a variant of the  Multi-compartment Multi-knapsack Problem with capacity penalties MCMKP. 
The notation used to describe the dynamical aspects in the model is based on the notation 
from the dynamic metaheuristics literature as found in \cite{yangMetaheuristicsDynamicCombinatorial2013}. 
Here the $\VarMetaTime$ is added as a time variable on all sets, parameters, and variables that are
subject to change while the metaheuristic is running. This enables us to be precise in the timing on 
the messages that are send to the Ab-LNS and understand how it reacts in real-time

\input{../../tex/models/strategic.tex}

The meta variables defines the broader setting that the model in implemented in.
\eqref{eqn:meta:scheduler:strategic} specicies that the model is
implemented for scheduler s. \eqref{eqn:meta:tactical:strategic} is the value
of a decision variable coming from a different model, here the supervisor. 
\eqref{eqn:meta:time:strategic} is the time variable that binds the whole 
system together. 

The objective function \eqref{eqn:objective:strategic},  maximizes the total
weighted delay of all work order assignments together with the penalty $
\ParStrategicPenalty$ for exceeding the resource capacity given in constraint
\eqref{eqn:constraint:strategic:resource}. The third term   of the model
contains the $\ParClusteringValue$ which turns the model into a  quadratic
problem. This term optimizes the value of putting two work orders in the same
period, if they have share similarity like close proximity,  same functional
location, etc.  Constraint \eqref{eqn:constraint:strategic:resource} ensures
that all the weights $\ParOperationWork{wr}$ for each activity in an work
order, given that it has been assigned, is lower than the capacity for each
period and for each resources $\ElementResource$. $\ParStrategicPenalty$ is the
amount of exceeded capacity that is needed for the current assignment of work
order to be feasible. Constraint \eqref{eqn:constraint:strategic:schedule_once}
makes sure that each work order is assigned to at least a single
period. Constraint \eqref{eqn:constraint:strategic:exclude}
excludes a work order from a certain period and constraint
\eqref{eqn:constraint:strategic:include} forces a specific work order to be
in a specific period. Constraint \eqref{eqn:variable:strategic:assignment}
and \eqref{eqn:variable:strateigc:penalty} specify the variable domain
for $\VarStrategicWorkOrderAssignment{\ElementWorkOrder}{\ElementPeriod}$
and $\ParStrategicPenalty$ respectively. The effects of changing $
\ParStrategicInclude$, $\ParStrategicExclude$, $\ParStrategicResource$, and $
\ParStrategicValue$ in real-time will be examined to determine their effects on
the weekly schedules and objective value.
