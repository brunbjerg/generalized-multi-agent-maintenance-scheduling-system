Using data collected from manufacturers, we estimate the national losses due to inadequate maintenance and make comparisons between those that rely on reactive maintenance, preventive maintenance, and predictive maintenance. The total annual costs/losses associated with maintenance is estimated to be on average \$222.0 billion, as estimated using Monte Carlo analysis. Respondents were categorized into three groups and compared. The first group is the top 50 \% of respondents that rely on reactive maintenance, measured in expenditures. The remaining respondents were split in half based on their reliance on predictive maintenance. The top 50 \% of respondents in using reactive maintenance, measured in expenditures, compared to the other respondents suggests that there are substantial benefits of moving away from reactive maintenance toward preventive and/or predictive maintenance. The bottom 50 \%, which relies more heavily on predictive and preventive maintenance, had 52.7 \% less unplanned downtime and 78.5 \% less defects. The comparison between the smaller two groups, which rely more heavily on preventive and predictive maintenance, shows that there is 18.5 \% less unplanned downtime and 87.3 \% less defects for those that rely more on predictive than preventive.},

	abstract = {Dynamic pickup and delivery problems ({PDPs}) require online algorithms for managing a fleet of vehicles. Generally, vehicles can be managed either centrally or decentrally. A common way to coordinate agents decentrally is to use the contract-net protocol ({CNET}) that uses auctions to allocate tasks among agents. To participate in an auction, agents require a method that estimates the value of a task. Typically, this method involves an optimization algorithm, e.g. to calculate the cost to insert a customer. Recently, hyper-heuristics have been proposed for automated design of heuristics. Two properties of automatically designed heuristics are particularly promising: (1) a generated heuristic computes quickly, it is expected therefore that hyper-heuristics perform especially well for urgent problems, and (2) by using simulation-based evaluation, hyper-heuristics can create a ‘rule of thumb’ that anticipates situations in the future. In the present paper we empirically evaluate whether hyper-heuristics, more specifically genetic programming ({GP}), can be used to improve agents decentrally coordinated via {CNET}. We compare several {GP} settings and compare the resulting heuristic with existing centralized and decentralized algorithms based on the {OptaPlanner} optimization library. The tests are conducted in real-time on a dynamic {PDP} dataset with varying levels of dynamism, urgency, and scale. The results indicate that the evolved heuristic always outperforms the optimization algorithm in the decentralized multi-agent system ({MAS}) and often outperforms the centralized optimization algorithm. Our paper demonstrates that designing {MASs} using genetic programming is an effective way to obtain competitive performance compared to traditional operational research approaches. These results strengthen the relevance of decentralized agent based approaches in dynamic logistics.},

Such dynamic optimization problems ({DOPs}) are challenging problems for researchers and practitioners in decision-making due to their nature of difficulty. Yet, they are important problems that decision-makers in many domains need to face and solve. Evolutionary computation ({EC}) is a class of stochastic optimization methods that mimic principles from natural evolution to solve optimization and search problems. {EC} methods are good tools to address {DOPs} due to their inspiration from natural and biological evolution, which has always been subject to changing environments. {EC} for {DOPs} has attracted a lot of research effort during the last twenty years with some promising results. However, this research area is still quite young and far away from well-understood. This tutorial aims to summarize the research area of {EC} for {DOPs} and attract potential young researchers into the important research area. It will provide an introduction to the research area of {EC} for {DOPs} and carry out an in-depth description of the state-of-the-art of research in the field regarding the following five aspects: benchmark problems and generators, performance measures, algorithmic approaches, theoretical studies, and applications. Some future research issues and directions regarding {EC} for {DOPs} will also be presented. The purpose is to (i) provide clear definition and classification of {DOPs}; (ii) review current approaches and provide detailed explanations on how they work; (iii) review the strengths and weaknesses of each approach; (iv) discuss the current assumptions and coverage of existing research on {EC} for {DOPs}; and (v) identify current gaps, challenges, and opportunities in {EC} for {DOPs}.},

	abstract = {Optimization in dynamic environments is a hot research area that has attracted a notable attention in the past decade. It is clear from the dynamic optimization literature that most of the effort is devoted to continuous dynamic optimization problems although majority of the real-life problems are combinatorial. Additionally, in comparison to evolutionary or population-based approaches, constructive search strategy, which is shown to be successful in stationary combinatorial optimization problems, is commonly ignored by the dynamic optimization community. In the present work, a constructive and multi-start search strategy is proposed to solve dynamic multi-dimensional knapsack problem, which has numerous applications in real world. Making use of constructive and multi-start features, the aim here is to test the performance of such a strategy and to observe its behavior in dynamically changing environments. In this regard, this strategy is compared to the well-known evolutionary and population-based approaches, including a Genetic Algorithm-based memetic algorithm, Differential Evolution algorithm, Firefly Algorithm and a hyper-heuristic, which employs these population-based algorithms as low-level heuristics in accordance with their individual contributions. Furthermore, in order to improve their performances in dynamic environments, the mentioned evolutionary algorithms are enhanced by using triggered random immigrants and adaptive hill climbing strategies. As one can see from the comprehensive experimental analysis, while the proposed approach outperforms most of the evolutionary-based approaches, it is outperformed by firefly and hyper-heuristic algorithms in some of the instances. This points out competiveness of the proposed approaches. Finally, according to the statistical results of non-parametric tests, one can conclude that the proposed approach can be considered as a promising and a competitive algorithm in dynamic environments.},

Designing algorithms to find and track desirable solutions while facing challenges of dynamic optimization problems is an active research topic in the field of swarm and evolutionary computation. To evaluate and compare the performance of algorithms, it is imperative to use a suitable benchmark that generates problem instances with different controllable characteristics. In this article, we give a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks and investigate their shortcomings in capturing different problem features. We then propose a highly configurable benchmark suite, the generalized moving peaks benchmark, capable of generating problem instances whose components have a variety of properties, such as different levels of ill-conditioning, variable interactions, shape, and complexity. Moreover, components generated by the proposed benchmark can be highly dynamic with respect to the gradients, heights, optimum locations, condition numbers, shapes, complexities, and variable interactions. Finally, several well-known optimizers and dynamic optimization algorithms are chosen to solve generated problems by the proposed benchmark. The experimental results show the poor performance of the existing methods in facing new challenges posed by the addition of new properties.},

	abstract = {This article reviews the state-of-the-art developments in Multi-Agent Systems ({MASs}) and their application to energy optimization problems. This methodology and related tools have contributed to changes in various paradigms used in energy optimization. Behavior and interactions between agents are key elements that must be understood in order to model energy optimization solutions that are robust, scalable and context-aware. The concept of {MAS} is introduced in this paper and it is compared with traditional approaches in the development of energy optimization solutions. The different types of agent-based architectures are described, the role played by the environment is analysed and we look at how {MAS} recognizes the characteristics of the environment to adapt to it. Moreover, it is discussed how {MAS} can be used as tools that simulate the results of different actions aimed at reducing energy consumption. Then, we look at {MAS} as a tool that makes it easy to model and simulate certain behaviors. This modeling and simulation is easily extrapolated to the energy field, and can even evolve further within this field by using the Internet of Things ({IoT}) paradigm. Therefore, we can argue that {MAS} is a widespread approach in the field of energy optimization and that it is commonly used due to its capacity for the communication, coordination, cooperation of agents and the robustness that this methodology gives in assigning different tasks to agents. Finally, this article considers how {MASs} can be used for various purposes, from capturing sensor data to decision-making. We propose some research perspectives on the development of electrical optimization solutions through their development using {MASs}. In conclusion, we argue that researchers in the field of energy optimization should use multi-agent systems at those junctures where it is necessary to model energy efficiency solutions that involve a wide range of factors, as well as context independence that they can achieve through the addition of new agents or agent organizations, enabling the development of energy-efficient solutions for smart cities and intelligent buildings.},

This survey paper aims to offer a detailed overview of existing distributed optimization algorithms and their applications in power systems. More specifically, we first review discrete-time and continuous-time distributed optimization algorithms for undirected graphs. We then discuss how to extend these algorithms in various directions to handle more realistic scenarios.

	abstract = {Multi-agent systems ({MASs}) have received tremendous attention from scholars in different disciplines, including computer science and civil engineering, as a means to solve complex problems by subdividing them into smaller tasks. The individual tasks are allocated to autonomous entities, known as agents. Each agent decides on a proper action to solve the task using multiple inputs, e.g., history of actions, interactions with its neighboring agents, and its goal. The {MAS} has found multiple applications, including modeling complex systems, smart grids, and computer networks. Despite their wide applicability, there are still a number of challenges faced by {MAS}, including coordination between agents, security, and task allocation. This survey provides a comprehensive discussion of all aspects of {MAS}, starting from definitions, features, applications, challenges, and communications to evaluation. A classification on {MAS} applications and challenges is provided along with references for further studies. We expect this paper to serve as an insightful and comprehensive resource on the {MAS} for researchers and practitioners in the area.},

	abstract = {The field of dynamic optimisation continuously designs and compares algorithms with adaptation abilities that deal with changing problems during their search process. However, restarting the search algorithm after a detected change is sometimes a better option than adaptation, although it is generally ignored in empirical studies. In this paper, we suggest the elusivity formulation to (i) quantify the preference for restart over adaptation for algorithms running on dynamic problems, and (ii) evaluate the advantage and behaviour of adaptation. Informally, we state that a dynamic problem is elusive to an algorithm if restart is more effective than adapting to changes. After reviewing existing formalisms for dynamic optimisation, the elusivity concept is mathematically defined and applied to two published empirical studies to evaluate its utility. Conducted experiments show that replicated works include elusive problems, where restart is better than (or equal to) adaptation, and demonstrate that some empirical research effort is being devoted to evaluating adaptive algorithms in circumstances where there is no advantage. Hence, we recommend how and when elusivity analysis can be gainfully included in empirical studies in the field of dynamic optimisation.},

It is thus time-consuming for (bounded-sub)optimal solvers to solve large {MAPF} instances. Anytime algorithms find solutions quickly for large instances and then improve them to close-to-optimal ones over time. In this paper, we improve the current state-of-the-art anytime solver {MAPF}-{LNS}, that first finds an initial solution fast and then repeatedly replans the paths of subsets of agents via Large Neighborhood Search ({LNS}). It generates the subsets of agents for replanning by randomized destroy heuristics, but not all of them increase the solution quality substantially. We propose to use machine learning to learn how to select a subset of agents from a collection of subsets, such that replanning increases the solution quality more. We show experimentally that our solver, {MAPF}-{ML}-{LNS}, significantly outperforms {MAPF}-{LNS} on the standard {MAPF} benchmark set in terms of both the speed of improving the solution and the final solution quality.},

It will play a key role in the acceptance of emerging {AI} applications such as optimisation. Two important factors known to affect trust are system transparency, i.e., how well the user understands how the system works, and system performance. However, in the case of optimisation, it is difficult for the end-user to understand the underlying algorithms or to judge the quality of the solution. Through two controlled user studies, we explore whether the user is better able to calibrate their trust in the system when: (a) They are provided feedback on the system operation in the form of visualisation of intermediate solutions and their quality; (b) They can interactively explore the solution space by modifying the solution returned by the system. We found that showing intermediate solutions can lead to over-trust, while interactive exploration leads to more accurately calibrated trust. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Since its dawn as a discipline, Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) has focused on mimicking the human mental processes. As {AI} applications matured, the interest for employing them into real-world complex systems (i.e., coupling {AI} with Cyber-Physical Systems—{CPS}) kept increasing. In the last decades, the multi-agent systems ({MAS}) paradigm has been among the most relevant approaches fostering the development of intelligent systems. In numerous scenarios, {MAS} boosted distributed autonomous reasoning and behaviors. However, many real-world applications (e.g., {CPS}) demand the respect of strict timing constraints. Unfortunately, current {AI}/{MAS} theories and applications only reason “about time” and are incapable of acting “in time” guaranteeing any timing predictability. This paper analyzes the {MAS} compliance with strict timing constraints (real-time compliance)—crucial for safety-critical applications such as healthcare, industry 4.0, and automotive. Moreover, it elicits the main reasons for the lack of real-time satisfiability in {MAS} (originated from current theories, standards, and implementations). In particular, traditional internal agent schedulers (general-purpose-like), communication middlewares, and negotiation protocols have been identified as co-factors inhibiting real-time compliance. To pave the road towards reliable and predictable {MAS}, this paper postulates a formal definition and mathematical model of real-time multi-agent systems ({RT}-{MAS}). Furthermore, this paper presents the results obtained by testing the dynamics characterizing the {RT}-{MAS} model within the simulator {MAXIM}-{GPRT}. Thus, it has been possible to analyze the deadline miss ratio between the algorithms employed in the most popular frameworks and the proposed ones. Finally, discussing the obtained results, the ongoing and future steps are outlined.},

This paper presents {GoOrg}, a model that uses as input a set of goals and a set of available agents to generate different arrangements of organisational structures made up of synthesised organisational positions. The most distinguishing characteristics of {GoOrg} are the use of organisational positions instead of roles and that positions are automatically synthesised rather than required as a priori defined inputs. These characteristics facilitate the parametrisation, the use for resource planning and the chance of finding feasible solutions. This paper also introduces two model extensions, which define processes and constraints that illustrate how {GoOrg} suits different domains.

	abstract = {While the progress of predictive maintenance has been rising in various application fields and several feasibility studies and prototypes have been developed, the operational implementation of predictive maintenance requires a more flexible and adaptive scheduling of the predicted maintenance interventions. Contrary to the traditional preventive maintenance tasks that are typically known long in advance, predictive maintenance may require very short-term schedule changes which are also affecting the operation. Railway rolling stock has some special requirements in terms of time table adherence and vehicle scheduling and routing that make the operational implementation of predictive maintenance particularly challenging. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework for the predictive maintenance scheduling of passenger railway wagons. Besides fulfilling the requirement of scheduling the maintenance of a wagon before it fails (and potentially causes delays), also the passenger demand must be satisfied and the trains must be accordingly assigned to different routes following the time table. We propose a hierarchical distributed learning algorithm using dual decomposition and mechanism design approach. The proposed framework enables to preserve local preferences and particularities and to avoid high computational cost. In the proposed method, first, we decompose the centralized problem using the dual decomposition method, and handle the passenger demand fulfillment constraints by Lagrange multiplier (“shadow price”). Furthermore, the wagons with the private information on the system health need to perform the maintenance before their failure time (with a predicted remaining useful lifetime ({RUL}) and the corre­ sponding uncertainty). To achieve this aim, we propose a mechanism design approach to align the wagons’ objective function to the aim of the central system using an incentive signal. The incentive signal creates a noncooperative game among the wagons. We prove that the Nash Equilibrium ({NE}) of this game is the optimal solution of the predictive maintenance scheduling. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a case study of a small railway network.},

Preventive maintenance is often being followed in the industry, which, if not considered while scheduling, may lead to unrealistic/sub-optimal schedules. Despite the importance of maintenance planning while scheduling, the problem has attracted very little attention in the literature. Further, the existing approaches assume centralized decision-making which not only suffers from low scalability but is not amenable to futuristic manufacturing systems such as industry 4.0. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no decentralized system has been reported for integrated scheduling and maintenance planning of the {FJS}. This paper proposes a multi-agent system, a popular approach for decentralized decision-making, for integrated scheduling and maintenance planning of {FJSP}. The efficacy of our approach is compared with the existing approaches by solving 11 problem instances with fixed (to be performed at the predefined time) and flexible (to be performed any time within a time window) maintenance.},

Although multi-asset systems have been studied numerous times in the past decades, maintenance planning implications of the system’s network characteristics have been barely analysed. Likewise, solutions that consider the network perspective suffer from scalability issues as a network-wide observability is assumed. This paper proposes a network maintenance planning approach based on the decomposition of the multiasset network into fixed-size localised subnetworks. The overall network maintenance plan is produced by aggregating the subnetwork maintenance plans, which are computed independently via a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning ({MARL}) algorithm. The results are evaluated against a network-wide approach as well as the commonly-used individual approach. The paper also introduces a systematic approach to integrate the {MARL} resulting policy in a multi-asset agent-based model. Simulation results of several random asset networks and a large nationwide network infrastructure show that, although a network-wide approach outperforms, on average, other approaches considered, the localised subnetworks approach, provides an acceptable alternative in networks with small-world properties, without the need of a network-wide view.},

	abstract = {This work presents an approach for distributed and contextualized reasoning in multi-agent systems, considering environments in which agents may have incomplete, uncertain and inconsistent knowledge. Knowledge is represented by defeasible logic with mapping rules, which model the capability of agents to acquire knowledge from other agents during reasoning. Based on such knowledge representation, an argumentation-based reasoning model that enables distributed building of reusable argument structures to support conclusions is proposed. Conﬂicts between arguments are resolved by an argument strength calculation that considers the trust among agents and the degree of similarity between knowledge of different agents, based on the intuition that greater similarity between knowledge deﬁned by different agents implies in less uncertainty about the validity of the built argument. Contextualized reasoning is supported through sharing of relevant knowledge by an agent when issuing queries to other agents, which enable the cooperating agents to be aware of knowledge not known a priori but that is important to reach a reasonable conclusion given the context of the agent that issued the query. A distributed algorithm is presented and analytically and experimentally evaluated asserting its computational feasibility. Finally, our approach is compared to related work, highlighting the contributions presented, demonstrating its applicability in a broader range of scenarios, and presenting perspectives for future work.},

	abstract = {Joint maintenance and production scheduling is very important and challenging in the smart manufacturing field. Multi-agent systems based on Contract-Net Protocol ({CNP}) have been proposed to solve this scheduling problem, to reduce complexity, increase flexibility, and enhance robustness. However, these multi-agent approaches use myopic behaviors which can cause loss of performance. This study aims to improve the {CNP}-based approach of joint production and maintenance scheduling by reducing loss of performance due to agent myopia. Based on a Pigouvian approach of externalities, a new multi-agent scheduling system {RCEMP} (Regulator, Customers, Environment, Maintainers, and Producers) was developed to improve the multi-agent system {SCEMP} (Supervisor, Customers, Environment, Maintainers, and Producers). We have implemented the {SCEMP} and {RCEMP} approaches with Python programming language, simulated them with a fixed set of problem instances and compared their performances with the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. These comparisons show that the approach in terms of externalities improves significantly the performances of the {CNP}-based approach in terms of regular classical optimality criteria of scheduling, maintenance costs, and execution times.},

This paper proposes a negotiation-based, partial rescheduling method, combined with an existing multi-agent system, to swap jobs between machines. The negotiations are restricted to machines within the same work center, giving rise to a partial reschedule. A learning algorithm is also utilized, allowing machines to individually learn how to evaluate proposed bids from other machines and adapt the bids to their current environment. The main objective is to minimize the mean weighted tardiness of all jobs. Computational results indicate an improvement of 10–30 tardiness, compared to continuous rescheduling and complete rescheduling methods. In addition, a decrease of 70–80 sensitivity analysis and analysis of the partial reschedule.},

The interaction with an end user or decision maker aims at improving the efficiency of the optimization procedure, enriching the optimization model, or informing the user regarding the solutions proposed by the optimization system. First, we present the challenges of using optimization methods as a tool for supporting decision making, and we justify the integration of the user in the optimization process. This integration is generally achieved via a dynamic interaction between the user and the system. Next, the different classes of interactive optimization approaches are presented. This detailed review includes trial and error, interactive reoptimization, interactive multiobjective optimization, interactive evolutionary algorithms, human-guided search, and other approaches that are less well covered in the research literature. On the basis of this review, we propose a classification that aims to better describe and compare interaction mechanisms. This classification offers two complementary views on interactive optimization methods. The first perspective focuses on the user’s contribution to the optimization process, and the second concerns the components of interactive optimization systems. Finally, on the basis of this review and classification, we identify some open issues and potential perspectives for interactive optimization methods.},

	abstract = {Optimization models used in planning and scheduling systems are not exempt from inaccuracies. These optimization systems often require an expert to assess solutions and to adjust them before taking decisions. However, adjusting a solution computed by an optimization procedure is difficult, especially because of the cascading effect. A small modification in a candidate solution may require to modify a large part of the solution. This obstacle to the adjustment of a solution can be overcome by interactive reoptimization. In this paper we analyze the impact of the cascading effect on a shift-scheduling problem and propose an efficient heuristic approach for reoptimizing solutions. The proposed approach is a local-search metaheuristic that has been adapted to the reoptimization. This approach is evaluated on a set of problem instances on which additional preferences are generated to simulate desired adjustments of a decision maker. Experimental results indicate that, even with a small perturbation, the cascading effect is manifest and cannot be efficiently tackled by applying recovery actions. Moreover, results show that the proposed reoptimization method provides significant cost gains within a short time while keeping a level of simplicity and modularity adequate for an implementation in a decision support system. © 2014 is held by the owner/author(s).},

In order to survive in the turbulent environment, manufacturing organisations must become flexible and responsive to these dynamic changes in the business environment. This paper presents a hierarchical agent bidding mechanism that is particularly designed for Make-to-Order manufacturing system and attempts to enhance the operational flexibility of manufacturing system in dealing with dynamic changes in the business environment. The novelty of this mechanism is that it enables manufacturing resources to be self-organised cost-efficiently within structural constraints of manufacturing system for fulfilling customer orders. However, when orders cannot be fulfilled within the structural constraints of manufacturing systems, the mechanism can enable manufacturing resources to be regrouped flexibly across system boundaries but with minimum disturbances to existing system structure. Based on an example application to a manufacturing company, this paper demonstrates that the operational flexibility provided by this mechanism is able to help manufacturing system to respond demand fluctuation through balancing the capacity across the entire system. Meanwhile, this mechanism potentially enables manufacturing systems to deal with unexpected changes in product type. As long as the manufacturing system has the technicality required by a new product, this mechanism enables resources across the manufacturing system to be cost-efficiently and flexibly self-organised to fulfil the new product.},

	abstract = {The companies dealing with multiple projects are geographically distributed at different locations. These projects require local (always available to the concerned project) and global (shared among the projects) resources that are available in limited quantity. The global resources are generally required to be transferred physically among the projects, consuming signiﬁcant amounts of both time and cost. The existing multi-agent systems for decentralized resource constrained multi-project scheduling problem ({DRCMPSP}) do not consider the resource transfer time and related cost for execution and control. We introduce {DRCMPSP}-{RT} that explicitly considers the transfer of shared global resources. This paper proposes a novel distributed multi-agent system using auctions based negotiation ({DMAS}/{RIA}) approach for the resource intervals and allocating multiple different types of shared resources amongst multiple competing projects.},

	abstract = {In many cases of today’s planning tasks, the synchronization of production and distribution is becoming increasingly important in order to minimize costs and to maximize customer satisfaction. This is especially the case if transport schedules are closely connected to production schedules, as it is in the newspaper industry—where perishable goods are distributed immediately after production. In order to achieve the above mentioned competing objectives, a special kind of vehicle routing problem, the vehicle routing problem with time windows and cluster-dependent tour starts ({VRPTWCD}), has to be solved. Moreover, the varying print and post-processing schedules due to unknown editorial deadlines lead to the need for a dynamic online control of the newspaper production and distribution process. In this contribution, the outlined dynamic transport problem is solved online under consideration of unforeseen changes in production schedules. The solution concept is based on a multi-agent system consisting of, amongst others, several Edition and Vehicle Agents. This system is exemplarily applied to a real life application case of one of the largest German newspaper companies. It is shown that a static (centralized) optimization of the underlying problem would even lead to worse results in comparison to the current situation and that the appliance of the multi-agent system is suitable in the newspaper industry.},

	abstract = {A bilevel programming model represents the relationship in a specific decision process that involves decisions within a hierarchical structure of two levels. The upper-level problem is associated with the decision maker with higher hierarchy, and the nested problem is associated with a lower-level. This modeling approach has been applied to diverse real-life situations. However, exact solution methods are limited due to the inherent complexity of bilevel optimization models. Therefore, alternative solution methods are needed, such as metaheuristics. The design and implementation of effective metaheuristic algorithms that produce goodquality solutions in acceptable computational time has been an active research area. Recently, there has been an increase in this area of research. This study aims to review all the published papers devoted to implementing metaheuristics for solving bilevel problems up-to-date. A bibliometric analysis is performed to track the evolution of this topic. Also, the journals and authors with more contributions are identified. The specific components of the proposed metaheuristics are described in detail, independent of the inspiration behind the metaheuristics. A detailed analysis of the combination of components is included to determine the more common ones. Additionally, classification of the manner in which the crucial bilevel aspects of the problem are handled in the metaheuristics, is detailed, for example, the type of approach considered for designing the metaheuristic, what can be nested, single-level reformulation, co-evolutionary, and biobjective transformation. Also, the metaheuristics that assume a unique follower’s reaction, the optimistic or pessimistic approaches are noted. A discussion regarding the interesting findings is included, in which a critic of lax practices is conducted. Some areas of opportunity for research and promising recent approaches are listed. Finally, relevant conclusions of this exhaustive review are presented.},
