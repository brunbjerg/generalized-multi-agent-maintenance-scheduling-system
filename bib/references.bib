	            tasks; agents may dynamically synchronize, exchange data, adapt
	            their behaviour, and reconfigure their communication interfaces.
	            Inspired by existing multi-robot systems, we represent a system
	            as a set of agents (each with local state), executing
	            independently and only influence each other by means of message
	            exchange. Agents are able to sense their local states and
	            partially their surroundings. We extend ltl to be able to reason
	            explicitly about the intentions of agents in the interaction and
	            their communication protocols. We also study the complexity of
	            satisfiability and model-checking of this extension.},

	            sometimes a better option than adaptation, although it is
	            generally ignored in empirical studies. In this paper, we suggest
	            the elusivity formulation to (i) quantify the preference for

	            elusive to an algorithm if restart is more effective than
	            adapting to changes. After reviewing existing formalisms for
	            dynamic optimisation, the elusivity concept is mathematically
	            defined and applied to two published empirical studies to
	            evaluate its utility. Conducted experiments show that replicated

	            equal to) adaptation, and demonstrate that some empirical
	            research effort is being devoted to evaluating adaptive
	            algorithms in circumstances where there is no advantage. Hence,
	            we recommend how and when elusivity analysis can be gainfully

	            definitions of organisational roles and usually are not suitable
	            for planning resource use. This paper presents GoOrg, a model

	            to generate different arrangements of organisational structures
	            made up of synthesised organisational positions. The most
	            distinguishing characteristics of GoOrg are the use of

	abstract = {Optimization in dynamic environments is a hot research area that
	            has attracted a notable attention in the past decade. It is clear
	            from the dynamic optimization literature that most of the effort
	            is devoted to continuous dynamic optimization problems although
	            majority of the real-life problems are combinatorial.
	            Additionally, in comparison to evolutionary or population-based
	            approaches, constructive search strategy, which is shown to be
	            successful in stationary combinatorial optimization problems, is
	            commonly ignored by the dynamic optimization community. In the
	            present work, a constructive and multi-start search strategy is
	            proposed to solve dynamic multi-dimensional knapsack problem,
	            which has numerous applications in real world. Making use of
	            constructive and multi-start features, the aim here is to test
	            the performance of such a strategy and to observe its behavior in
	            dynamically changing environments. In this regard, this strategy
	            is compared to the well-known evolutionary and population-based
	            approaches, including a Genetic Algorithm-based memetic algorithm
	            , Differential Evolution algorithm, Firefly Algorithm and a
	            hyper-heuristic, which employs these population-based algorithms
	            as low-level heuristics in accordance with their individual
	            contributions. Furthermore, in order to improve their
	            performances in dynamic environments, the mentioned evolutionary
	            algorithms are enhanced by using triggered random immigrants and
	            adaptive hill climbing strategies. As one can see from the
	            comprehensive experimental analysis, while the proposed approach
	            outperforms most of the evolutionary-based approaches, it is
	            outperformed by firefly and hyper-heuristic algorithms in some of
	            the instances. This points out competitiveness of the proposed
	            approaches. Finally, according to the statistical results of
	            non-parametric tests, one can conclude that the proposed approach
	            can be considered as a promising and a competitive algorithm in
	            dynamic environments.},

	            order to minimize costs and to maximize customer satisfaction.
	            This is especially the case if transport schedules are closely
	            connected to production schedules, as it is in the newspaper
	            industry---where perishable goods are distributed immediately
	            after production. In order to achieve the above mentioned
	            competing objectives, a special kind of vehicle routing problem,
	            the vehicle routing problem with time windows and
	            cluster-dependent tour starts (VRPTWCD), has to be solved.
	            Moreover, the varying print and post-processing schedules due to
	            unknown editorial deadlines lead to the need for a dynamic online
	            control of the newspaper production and distribution process. In
	            this contribution, the outlined dynamic transport problem is
	            solved online under consideration of unforeseen changes in
	            production schedules. The solution concept is based on a
	            multi-agent system consisting of, amongst others, several Edition

	            life application case of one of the largest German newspaper

	            of the underlying problem would even lead to worse results in

	abstract = {Since its dawn as a discipline, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
	            focused on mimicking the human mental processes. As AI
	            applications matured, the interest for employing them into
	            real-world complex systems (i.e., coupling AI with Cyber-Physical
	            Systems---CPS) kept increasing. In the last decades, the
	            multi-agent systems (MAS) paradigm has been among the most
	            relevant approaches fostering the development of intelligent
	            systems. In numerous scenarios, MAS boosted distributed
	            autonomous reasoning and behaviors. However, many real-world
	            applications (e.g., CPS) demand the respect of strict timing
	            constraints. Unfortunately, current AI/MAS theories and
	            applications only reason ``about time'' and are incapable of
	            acting ``in time'' guaranteeing any timing predictability. This
	            paper analyzes the MAS compliance with strict timing constraints
	            (real-time compliance)---crucial for safety-critical applications
	            such as healthcare, industry 4.0, and automotive. Moreover, it
	            elicits the main reasons for the lack of real-time satisfiability
	            in MAS (originated from current theories, standards, and
	            implementations). In particular, traditional internal agent
	            schedulers (general-purpose-like), communication middlewares, and
	            negotiation protocols have been identified as co-factors
	            inhibiting real-time compliance. To pave the road towards
	            reliable and predictable MAS, this paper postulates a formal
	            definition and mathematical model of real-time multi-agent
	            systems (RT-MAS). Furthermore, this paper presents the results
	            obtained by testing the dynamics characterizing the RT-MAS model
	            within the simulator MAXIM-GPRT. Thus, it has been possible to
	            analyze the deadline miss ratio between the algorithms employed
	            in the most popular frameworks and the proposed ones. Finally,
	            discussing the obtained results, the ongoing and future steps are
	            outlined.},

	            this paper, a metaheuristic procedure based on an Adaptive Large

	            Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP) with limited vehicles and

	            flexible job shop production layout and addressed several issues
	            that usually take place in practice. The addressed issues are:
	            new job arrivals, unexpected due date changes, machine
	            degradation, random breakdowns, minimal repairs, and
	            condition-based maintenance (CBM). We have proposed a real-time
	            optimization-based system that utilizes a modified hybrid genetic
	            algorithm, an integrated proactive-reactive optimization model,
	            and hybrid rescheduling policies. A set of modified benchmark
	            problems is used to test the proposed system by comparing its
	            performance to several other optimization algorithms and methods
	            used in practice. The results show the superiority of the
	            proposed system for solving the problem under study. The results
	            also emphasize the importance of the quality of the generated
	            baseline plans (i.e., initial integrated plans), the use of
	            hybrid rescheduling policies, and the impor\- tance of
	            rescheduling times (i.e., reaction times) for cost savings.},

	abstract = {This article reviews the state-of-the-art developments in
	            Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) and their application to energy
	            optimization problems. This methodology and related tools have
	            contributed to changes in various paradigms used in energy
	            optimization. Behavior and interactions between agents are key
	            elements that must be understood in order to model energy
	            optimization solutions that are robust, scalable and
	            context-aware. The concept of MAS is introduced in this paper and
	            it is compared with traditional approaches in the development of
	            energy optimization solutions. The different types of agent-based
	            architectures are described, the role played by the environment
	            is analysed and we look at how MAS recognizes the characteristics
	            of the environment to adapt to it. Moreover, it is discussed how
	            MAS can be used as tools that simulate the results of different
	            actions aimed at reducing energy consumption. Then, we look at
	            MAS as a tool that makes it easy to model and simulate certain
	            behaviors. This modeling and simulation is easily extrapolated to
	            the energy field, and can even evolve further within this field
	            by using the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Therefore, we can
	            argue that MAS is a widespread approach in the field of energy
	            optimization and that it is commonly used due to its capacity for
	            the communication, coordination, cooperation of agents and the
	            robustness that this methodology gives in assigning different
	            tasks to agents. Finally, this article considers how MASs can be
	            used for various purposes, from capturing sensor data to
	            decision-making. We propose some research perspectives on the
	            development of electrical optimization solutions through their
	            development using MASs. In conclusion, we argue that researchers
	            in the field of energy optimization should use multi-agent
	            systems at those junctures where it is necessary to model energy
	            efficiency solutions that involve a wide range of factors, as
	            well as context independence that they can achieve through the
	            addition of new agents or agent organizations, enabling the
	            development of energy-efficient solutions for smart cities and
	            intelligent buildings.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, manufacturing organisations face increasing pressures
	            from the frequent change in product type, continuous demand
	            fluctuation and unexpected change in customer requirements. In
	            order to survive in the turbulent environment, manufacturing
	            organisations must become flexible and responsive to these
	            dynamic changes in the business environment. This paper presents
	            a hierarchical agent bidding mechanism that is particularly
	            designed for Make-to-Order manufacturing system and attempts to
	            enhance the operational flexibility of manufacturing system in
	            dealing with dynamic changes in the business environment. The
	            novelty of this mechanism is that it enables manufacturing
	            resources to be self-organised cost-efficiently within structural
	            constraints of manufacturing system for fulfilling customer
	            orders. However, when orders cannot be fulfilled within the
	            structural constraints of manufacturing systems, the mechanism
	            can enable manufacturing resources to be regrouped flexibly
	            across system boundaries but with minimum disturbances to
	            existing system structure. Based on an example application to a
	            manufacturing company, this paper demonstrates that the
	            operational flexibility provided by this mechanism is able to
	            help manufacturing system to respond demand fluctuation through
	            balancing the capacity across the entire system. Meanwhile, this
	            mechanism potentially enables manufacturing systems to deal with
	            unexpected changes in product type. As long as the manufacturing
	            system has the technicality required by a new product, this
	            mechanism enables resources across the manufacturing system to be
	            cost-efficiently and flexibly self-organised to fulfil the new
	            product.},

	            of collision-free paths for a team of agents in a common
	            environment. MAPF is NP-hard to solve optimally and, in some
	            cases, also bounded-suboptimally. It is thus time-consuming for
	            (bounded-sub)optimal solvers to solve large MAPF instances.
	            Anytime algorithms find solutions quickly for large instances and
	            then improve them to close-to-optimal ones over time. In this
	            paper, we improve the current state-of-the-art anytime solver
	            MAPF-LNS, that first finds an initial solution fast and then
	            repeatedly replans the paths of subsets of agents via Large
	            Neighborhood Search (LNS). It generates the subsets of agents for
	            replanning by randomized destroy heuristics, but not all of them
	            increase the solution quality substantially. We propose to use
	            machine learning to learn how to select a subset of agents from a
	            collection of subsets, such that replanning increases the
	            solution quality more. We show experimentally that our solver,
	            MAPF-ML-LNS, significantly outperforms MAPF-LNS on the standard
	            MAPF benchmark set in terms of both the speed of improving the

	            to solve this scheduling problem, to reduce complexity, increase

	            Two important factors known to affect trust are system
	            transparency, i.e., how well the user understands how the system
	            works, and system performance. However, in the case of
	            optimisation, it is difficult for the end-user to understand the
	            underlying algorithms or to judge the quality of the solution.
	            Through two controlled user studies, we explore whether the user
	            is better able to calibrate their trust in the system when: (a)
	            They are provided feedback on the system operation in the form of
	            visualisation of intermediate solutions and their quality; (b)
	            They can interactively explore the solution space by modifying

	            exploration leads to more accurately calibrated trust. {

	abstract = {Optimization models used in planning and scheduling systems are
	            not exempt from inaccuracies. These optimization systems often
	            require an expert to assess solutions and to adjust them before
	            taking decisions. However, adjusting a solution computed by an
	            optimization procedure is difficult, especially because of the
	            cascading effect. A small modification in a candidate solution
	            may require to modify a large part of the solution. This obstacle
	            to the adjustment of a solution can be overcome by interactive
	            reoptimization. In this paper we analyze the impact of the
	            cascading effect on a shift-scheduling problem and propose an
	            efficient heuristic approach for reoptimizing solutions. The
	            proposed approach is a local-search metaheuristic that has been
	            adapted to the reoptimization. This approach is evaluated on a
	            set of problem instances on which additional preferences are
	            generated to simulate desired adjustments of a decision maker.
	            Experimental results indicate that, even with a small
	            perturbation, the cascading effect is manifest and cannot be
	            efficiently tackled by applying recovery actions. Moreover,
	            results show that the proposed reoptimization method provides
	            significant cost gains within a short time while keeping a level
	            of simplicity and modularity adequate for an implementation in a
	            decision support system. {\copyright} 2014 is held by the

	            used for solving optimization problems. The interaction with an

	            informing the user regarding the solutions proposed by the
	            optimization system. First, we present the challenges of using
	            optimization methods as a tool for supporting decision making,
	            and we justify the integration of the user in the optimization
	            process. This integration is generally achieved via a dynamic
	            interaction between the user and the system. Next, the different
	            classes of interactive optimization approaches are presented.
	            This detailed review includes trial and error, interactive
	            reoptimization, interactive multiobjective optimization,
	            interactive evolutionary algorithms, human-guided search, and

	            complementary views on interactive optimization methods. The
	            first perspective focuses on the user's contribution to the
	            optimization process, and the second concerns the components of
	            interactive optimization systems. Finally, on the basis of this
	            review and classification, we identify some open issues and

	            contextualized reasoning in multi-agent systems, considering
	            environments in which agents may have incomplete, uncertain and
	            inconsistent knowledge. Knowledge is represented by defeasible
	            logic with mapping rules, which model the capability of agents to
	            acquire knowledge from other agents during reasoning. Based on
	            such knowledge representation, an argumentation-based reasoning
	            model that enables distributed building of reusable argument
	            structures to support conclusions is proposed. Conflicts between
	            arguments are resolved by an argument strength calculation that
	            considers the trust among agents and the degree of similarity
	            between knowledge of different agents, based on the intuition
	            that greater similarity between knowledge defined by different
	            agents implies in less uncertainty about the validity of the
	            built argument. Contextualized reasoning is supported through
	            sharing of relevant knowledge by an agent when issuing queries to
	            other agents, which enable the cooperating agents to be aware of
	            knowledge not known a priori but that is important to reach a
	            reasonable conclusion given the context of the agent that issued
	            the query. A distributed algorithm is presented and analytically
	            and experimentally evaluated asserting its computational
	            feasibility. Finally, our approach is compared to related work,
	            highlighting the contributions presented, demonstrating its

	            planning of the Flexible Job Shop (FJS). Preventive maintenance
	            is often being followed in the industry, which, if not considered
	            while scheduling, may lead to unrealistic/sub-optimal schedules.
	            Despite the importance of maintenance planning while scheduling,
	            the problem has attracted very little attention in the
	            literature. Further, the existing approaches assume centralized
	            decision-making which not only suffers from low scalability but
	            is not amenable to futuristic manufacturing systems such as
	            industry 4.0. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no
	            decentralized system has been reported for integrated scheduling
	            and maintenance planning of the FJS. This paper proposes a
	            multi-agent system, a popular approach for decentralized
	            decision-making, for integrated scheduling and maintenance
	            planning of FJSP. The efficacy of our approach is compared with

	            fixed (to be performed at the predefined time) and flexible (to

	abstract = {Maintenance planning of networked multi-asset systems is a
	            complex problem due to the inherent individual and collective
	            asset constraints and dynamics as well as the size of the system
	            and interdependencies among assets. Although multi-asset systems
	            have been studied numerous times in the past decades, maintenance
	            planning implications of the system's network characteristics
	            have been barely analysed. Likewise, solutions that consider the
	            network perspective suffer from scalability issues as a
	            network-wide observability is assumed. This paper proposes a
	            network maintenance planning approach based on the decomposition
	            of the multiasset network into fixed-size localised subnetworks.
	            The overall network maintenance plan is produced by aggregating
	            the subnetwork maintenance plans, which are computed
	            independently via a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
	            (MARL) algorithm. The results are evaluated against a
	            network-wide approach as well as the commonly-used individual
	            approach. The paper also introduces a systematic approach to
	            integrate the MARL resulting policy in a multi-asset agent-based
	            model. Simulation results of several random asset networks and a
	            large nationwide network infrastructure show that, although a
	            network-wide approach outperforms, on average, other approaches
	            considered, the localised subnetworks approach, provides an
	            acceptable alternative in networks with small-world properties,
	            without the need of a network-wide view.},

	abstract = {While the progress of predictive maintenance has been rising in
	            various application fields and several feasibility studies and
	            prototypes have been developed, the operational implementation of
	            predictive maintenance requires a more flexible and adaptive
	            scheduling of the predicted maintenance interventions. Contrary
	            to the traditional preventive maintenance tasks that are
	            typically known long in advance, predictive maintenance may
	            require very short-term schedule changes which are also affecting
	            the operation. Railway rolling stock has some special
	            requirements in terms of time table adherence and vehicle
	            scheduling and routing that make the operational implementation
	            of predictive maintenance particularly challenging. In this paper
	            , we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework for the
	            predictive maintenance scheduling of passenger railway wagons.
	            Besides fulfilling the requirement of scheduling the maintenance
	            of a wagon before it fails (and potentially causes delays), also
	            the passenger demand must be satisfied and the trains must be
	            accordingly assigned to different routes following the time
	            table. We propose a hierarchical distributed learning algorithm
	            using dual decomposition and mechanism design approach. The
	            proposed framework enables to preserve local preferences and
	            particularities and to avoid high computational cost. In the
	            proposed method, first, we decompose the centralized problem
	            using the dual decomposition method, and handle the passenger
	            demand fulfillment constraints by Lagrange multiplier (``shadow
	            price''). Furthermore, the wagons with the private information on
	            the system health need to perform the maintenance before their
	            failure time (with a predicted remaining useful lifetime (RUL)
	            and the corre\- sponding uncertainty). To achieve this aim, we
	            propose a mechanism design approach to align the wagons'
	            objective function to the aim of the central system using an
	            incentive signal. The incentive signal creates a noncooperative
	            game among the wagons. We prove that the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of
	            this game is the optimal solution of the predictive maintenance
	            scheduling. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
	            demonstrated on a case study of a small railway network.},

	            algorithms for managing a fleet of vehicles. Generally, vehicles
	            can be managed either centrally or decentrally. A common way to
	            coordinate agents decentrally is to use the contract-net protocol
	            (CNET) that uses auctions to allocate tasks among agents. To
	            participate in an auction, agents require a method that estimates
	            the value of a task. Typically, this method involves an
	            optimization algorithm, e.g. to calculate the cost to insert a
	            customer. Recently, hyper-heuristics have been proposed for
	            automated design of heuristics. Two properties of automatically
	            designed heuristics are particularly promising: (1) a generated
	            heuristic computes quickly, it is expected therefore that
	            hyper-heuristics perform especially well for urgent problems, and
	            (2) by using simulation-based evaluation, hyper-heuristics can
	            create a `rule of thumb' that anticipates situations in the
	            future. In the present paper we empirically evaluate whether
	            hyper-heuristics, more specifically genetic programming (GP), can
	            be used to improve agents decentrally coordinated via CNET. We
	            compare several GP settings and compare the resulting heuristic
	            with existing centralized and decentralized algorithms based on
	            the OptaPlanner optimization library. The tests are conducted in
	            real-time on a dynamic PDP dataset with varying levels of
	            dynamism, urgency, and scale. The results indicate that the
	            evolved heuristic always outperforms the optimization algorithm
	            in the decentralized multi-agent system (MAS) and often
	            outperforms the centralized optimization algorithm. Our paper
	            demonstrates that designing MASs using genetic programming is an
	            effective way to obtain competitive performance compared to
	            traditional operational research approaches. These results
	            strengthen the relevance of decentralized agent based approaches
	            in dynamic logistics.},

	            environments, where changes may occur over time regarding
	            optimization objectives, decision variables, and/or constraint
	            conditions. Such dynamic optimization problems (DOPs) are
	            challenging problems for researchers and practitioners in

	            important problems that decision-makers in many domains need to
	            face and solve. Evolutionary computation (EC) is a class of
	            stochastic optimization methods that mimic principles from
	            natural evolution to solve optimization and search problems. EC
	            methods are good tools to address DOPs due to their inspiration
	            from natural and biological evolution, which has always been
	            subject to changing environments. EC for DOPs has attracted a lot
	            of research effort during the last twenty years with some
	            promising results. However, this research area is still quite
	            young and far away from well-understood. This tutorial aims to
	            summarize the research area of EC for DOPs and attract potential
	            young researchers into the important research area. It will
	            provide an introduction to the research area of EC for DOPs and
