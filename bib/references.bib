	abstract = {The companies dealing with multiple projects are geographically distributed at different locations. These projects require local (always available to the concerned project) and global (shared among the projects) resources that are available in limited quantity. The global resources are generally required to be transferred physically among the projects, consuming signiﬁcant amounts of both time and cost. The existing multi-agent systems for decentralized resource constrained multi-project scheduling problem (DRCMPSP) do not consider the resource transfer time and related cost for execution and control. We introduce DRCMPSP-RT that explicitly considers the transfer of shared global resources. This paper proposes a novel distributed multi-agent system using auctions based negotiation (DMAS/RIA) approach for the resource intervals and allocating multiple different types of shared resources amongst multiple competing projects.},

	abstract = {To this day, continuous developments of technical systems and increasing reliance on equipment have resulted in a growing importance of effective maintenance activities. During the last couple of decades, a substantial amount of research has been carried out on this topic. In this study, we review more than two hundred papers on maintenance modeling and optimization that have appeared in the period 2001 to 2018. We begin by describing terms commonly used in the modeling process. Then, in our classification, we first distinguish single-unit and multi-unit systems. Further sub-classification follows, based on the state space of the deterioration process modeled. Other features that we discuss in this review are discrete and continuous condition monitoring, inspection, replacement, repair, and the various types of dependencies that may exist between units within systems. We end with the main developments during the review period and with potential future research directions.},

	abstract = {This paper studies and analyses the multi-skilled resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MSRCPSP). We present a new classification scheme based on an existing classification scheme for project scheduling problems. This allows researchers to classify all multi-skilled project scheduling problems and its extensions. Furthermore, we propose a new data generation procedure for the MSRCPSP and introduce multiple artificial datasets for varying research purposes. The new datasets are generated based on new multi-skilled resource parameters and are compared to existing benchmark datasets in the literature. A set of 7 empirical multi-skilled project instances from software and railway construction companies are collected in order to validate the quality of the artificial datasets. Solutions are obtained through a genetic algorithm and by solving a mixed-integer linear programming formulation with CPLEX 12.6. The hardness of the multi-skilled project instances is investigated in the computational experiments. An experimental analysis studies the impact of skill availability, workforce size and multi-skilling on the makespan of the project.},

	abstract = {This article presents a review and a classification of interactive optimization methods. These interactive methods are used for solving optimization problems. The interaction with an end user or decision maker aims at improving the efficiency of the optimization procedure, enriching the optimization model, or informing the user regarding the solutions proposed by the optimization system. First, we present the challenges of using optimization methods as a tool for supporting decision making, and we justify the integration of the user in the optimization process. This integration is generally achieved via a dynamic interaction between the user and the system. Next, the different classes of interactive optimization approaches are presented. This detailed review includes trial and error, interactive reoptimization, interactive multiobjective optimization, interactive evolutionary algorithms, human-guided search, and other approaches that are less well covered in the research literature. On the basis of this review, we propose a classification that aims to better describe and compare interaction mechanisms. This classification offers two complementary views on interactive optimization methods. The first perspective focuses on the user’s contribution to the optimization process, and the second concerns the components of interactive optimization systems. Finally, on the basis of this review and classification, we identify some open issues and potential perspectives for interactive optimization methods.},
