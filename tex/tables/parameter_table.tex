\section{Metavariables}
* $\tau$                     : absolute time (RENAME TO TAU)


% NOTES
% Absolute time should be tau
% Determine if we should use traits or work\_center
% t should be in the positive reals
% There are multiple things that needs to be handled in the SupervisorAgent which is 
% currently not being handled correctly.
