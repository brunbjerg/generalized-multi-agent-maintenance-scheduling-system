\section{Parameters}
\subsection{Strategic}
* $v_{wp}$: value of WorkOrder in period
* d: penalty of exceeding capacity
* clu: Gain from clustering two work orders
* cap_{ptau}: Capacity by period and trait

\subsection{Tactical}
v_{do}: value of tactical operation (RENAME)
pen: penalty of exceeding daily trait capacity
w_{co}: hours of work in an operation (RENAME)
R_{dc}: hours of available work for c(trait) (RENAME)
start-start: relations between operations that have start-start
finish-start: relations between operations that have finish-start
number_o: number of people required to complete the operation
operating_time: allowed hours to be worked on the operation per day
duration_lower_o: shortest allowed duration
duration_upper_o: longest allowed duration

\subsection{Supervisor}
\subsection{Operational}

\section{Variables}
\subsection{Strategic}
x_{wp}: Assignment of WorkOrder w to period p
pen_{ptau}: penalty for exceeding capacity in period p for trait tau


\subsection{Tactical}
y_{do}: work for each day
p_{cd}: penalty for exceeding capacity
\subsection{Supervisor}
\subsection{Operational}

\section{Metavariable}
t: absolute time (RENAME TO TAU)


% NOTES
% Absolute time should be tau
% Determine if we should use traits or work_center
% t should be in the positive reals
