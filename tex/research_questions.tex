	\item How to create modular algorithm components that can solve well defined decision problems while also integrating into a larger decision making process?
    \item What approaches can be used to implement a real-time scheduling system that coordinates multiple agents, each utilizing different mathematical models and metaheuristics?
    \item In what ways can metaheuristics be integrated into existing scheduling workflows and business IT infrastructures, such as ERP systems, to address complex operational problems involving multiple stakeholders?
    \item How to model a scheduling process where each decision affects the process itself?
