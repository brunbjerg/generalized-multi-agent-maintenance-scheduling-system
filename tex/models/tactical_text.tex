\section{The Tactical Model}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Respect precedence constraints
	\item Respect daily resource requirements for each trait
	\item Penalize exceeded daily capacity
\end{itemize}

After the strategic model has optimized its schedule the tactical agent will continue scheduling the output at a more detailed level. This means that now the tactical agent will schedule 
out on each of the days of the work orders scheduled by the strategic agent. 

The tactical model is responsible for providing an initial suggestion for a weekly schedule, below we see the model for the tactical agent.
