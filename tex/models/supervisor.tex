\section{The Supervisor Model}
The maintenance supervisor is considered the most central person in a maintenance scheduling system. 
All the work of the planner and scheduler should be considered a service for the supervisor.

The supervisor has multiple different responsibilities among them are: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Assigning work orders
	\item Creating a daily schedule
	\item Keeping the schedule up-to-date
\end{itemize}


\begin{alignat}{2}
	& Max \sum_{a \in \SetActivity{\VarTacticalWork}} \sum_{t \in \SetTechnician} \ParSupervisorValue * \VarSupervisorAssignment \\ 
	& \text{subject to:} \notag \\ 
	& \sum_{t \in \SetTechnician} \VarSupervisorAssignment = \VarSupervisorAssignmentWhole \cdot \ParNumberOfPeople \quad \quad \forall o \in \SetOperation  \\
	& \sum_{o \in \ParOperationsForWorkOrder} \VarSupervisorAssignmentWhole  \notag\\ 
	& = \ParOperationsInWorkOrder \notag\\ 
	& \forall w \in \SetWorkOrder \notag \\
	& \sum_{a \in \ParActivitiesForOperation} \VarSupervisorAssignment = 1 \notag\\
	& \forall o \in \SetOperation \forall t \in \SetTechnician \\  
	& \VarSupervisorAssignment \leq \ParFeasible \quad \forall o \in \SetOperation, \ t \in \SetTechnician \\
	& \VarSupervisorAssignment \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall o \in \SetOperation, t \in \SetTechnician \\ 
    & \VarMetaTime \in  [0, \infty] 
\end{alignat}

In the supervisor model shown in \ref{} the set $O$ and $W$ comes from the tactical algorithm
and value $v$ and the information of whether or not the operation can be assigned to a 
specific operational model comes from the operational model itself and is captured in the.

Can this be done? What should the Supervisor have here? He should have what is necessary to
handle the
