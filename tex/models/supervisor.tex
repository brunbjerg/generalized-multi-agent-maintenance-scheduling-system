\section{The Supervisor Model}
The maintenance supervisor is considered the most central person in a maintenance scheduling system. 
All the work of the planner and scheduler should be considered a service for the supervisor.

The supervisor has multiple different responsibilities among them are: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Assigning work orders
	\item Creating a daily schedule
	\item Keeping the schedule up-to-date
\end{itemize}


\begin{alignat}{2}
	& Max \sum_{o \in O} \sum_{w \in W} v_{ow}(t) * z_{ow}(t) \\ 
	&\text{subject to:} \notag \\ 
	&\sum_{w \in W} z_{ow}(t) \leq number_o \quad \quad \forall o \in O  \\
	& z_{ow}(t) \leq feasible_{ow}(t) \quad \forall o \in O, \ w \in W \\
	& z_{ow}(t) \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall o \in O, w \in W \\ 
    & t \in  [0, \infty] 
\end{alignat}

In the supervisor model shown in \ref{} the set $O$ and $W$ comes from the tactical algorithm
and value $v$ and the information of whether or not the operation can be assigned to a 
specific operational model comes from the operational model itself and is captured in the.
