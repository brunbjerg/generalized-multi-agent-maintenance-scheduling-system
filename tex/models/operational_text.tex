\section{The Operational Model}

Here the o is a single operation and o2 is another operation. It is crucial to understand here that the main
decision variable, $x$ defines an ordering of the operations that a single operational agent will do the 
operations in. 

The $\VarStartOfSegment{a}{k}$ is the start time of job $i$ in segment $k$ and $\VarFinishOfSegment{a}{k}$ is the finish time of job $i$ in segment $k$.
$\VarProcessingTime{a}{k}$ is the processing time of each segment.
