\section{The Strategic Model}


The Strategic Model have multiple different purposes.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Schedule Work Order out across the weekly periods
	\item Prioritize all the different released work orders
	\item Respect the available weekly hours available for each trait
\end{itemize}

The Strategic model is responsible for grouping work orders into weekly or biweekly periods depending on which kind of maintenance setup that one is running.
This kind of model closely resembles a variant of the multi-compartment multi-knapsack problem.
